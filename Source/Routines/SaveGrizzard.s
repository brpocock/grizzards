          ;; We have 30 potential Grizzards, which make up 5 bytes each.
          ;; So we store 0-11 in the first block, then 12-23 in the second block,
          ;; and 24-30 in the last block. Nominally, we could do something
          ;; exciting with the remaining 4 bytes in blocks 1 and 2 or the
          ;; remaining 34 bytes in block 3, but they're left alone for now.
