;;; Console Detection Routine

;;; By AtariAge user Batari â€”

;;;
;;; normally we'd use CLEAN_START, but to detect if console is 2600 or 7800
;;; we need to take a look at the ZP RAM values in $80, $D0, and $D1 before
;;; zeroing out RAM
;;;
;;;   if $D0 contains $2C and $D1 contains $A9 then
;;;       system = 7800           // game was loaded from Harmony menu on a 7800
;;;   else if both contain $00 then
;;;       system = ZP RAM $80     // game was flashed to Harmony/Melody so CDFJ
;;;                               // driver checked $D0 and $D1 for us and saved
;;;                               // results in $80
;;;   else
;;;       system = 2600           // game was loaded from Harmony menu on a 2600

DetectConsole:      .block

        ldx $d0
        beq confirmFlashed ; if $00 then game might be flashed on Harmony/Melody
        cpx #$2c
        bne is2600         ; if not $2C then loaded via Harmony Menu on 2600        
        ldx $d1
        cpx #$a9
        bne is2600
        dey                 ; 7800: y=$FF
        bne is7800           ; this will always branch
        
confirmFlashed:     
        ldx $d1
        bne is2600         ; if not $00 then loaded via Harmony Menu on 2600
        ldy $80             ; else get the value saved by the CDFJ driver
