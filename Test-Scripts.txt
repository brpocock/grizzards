SCRIPT 4.

Save game file: DRAGON
 - Start in dragon's lair
 - Music is Port Lion theme
 - Score ABC005
 - Touch Depot; PLAYED MANY HOURS
 - Select/C confirm Grizzard is Megax with 255's on all stats
 - Walk to screen north (big empty boss fight arena)

Manual set-up: For “many hours” you would need to leave the game running
for 43 days or  so, so that's unreasonable. For the  rest, you'd need to
fight through  the entire game  and defeat 2  dragons, then save  at the
Depot by the third dragon's lair. Probably far easier to hex edit a save
game file.
