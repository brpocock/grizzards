\chapter*{Introduction}\label{Introduction}

The  land of  Syrex  is  a dangerous  place.  Fierce  monsters roam  the
countryside. But luckily for you, you're a Grizzard handler!

\bigskip

Train your Grizzard to  use a variety of Moves to  take on the monsters.
Discover new kinds  of Grizzards with new capabilities.  Can you conquer
all the monsters of Syrex?

\bigskip

In the  \textit{Grizzards} videogame, you'll  roam the land  looking for
monsters. Monsters may  surprise you as you travel, or  you may see them
coming. When faced  with terrifying beasts, you'll  direct your Grizzard
to use its Moves to defend you and attack the monsters.

\twocolumn[\chapter{Setting Up}\label{Setting Up}]

\noindent{}To play \textit{Grizzards}, you will need:

\picaskip

\begin{ritemize}
\item  An Atari  console: the  Atari  Video Computer  System CX-2600  or
  a compatible console
\item A TV or video display
\item A joystick controller or a compatible gamepad
  \ifdefined\ATARIAGESAVE
  \item Optional: an AtariVox device with speakers or headphones
  \else
  \ifdefined\NOSAVE\else
\item A  memory device: an  AtariVox device with (optional)  speakers or
  headphones, or a MemCard or SaveKey device.
  \fi\fi
\item The \textit{Grizzards} game cartridge \ifdefined\ATARIAGESAVE\else
  or a multi-cart with the \textit{Grizzards} data on it. \fi
\end{ritemize}

\ifdefined\ATARIAGESAVE\else
\ifdefined\NOSAVE\else
\begin{figure*}[b]
  \begin{center}

    \fi
    \includegraphics[width=.75\columnwidth]{../Manual/AtariVox.jpeg}
  \end{center}
\end{figure*}
\fi
\fi

Set up  your console with your  TV or video display.  Connect a joystick
(or gamepad) to  the \emph{left} controller port\ifdefined\ATARIAGESAVE,
and  (optionally) your  AtariVox device  to the  \emph{right} controller
port.  \else\ifdefined\NOSAVE.\else{},  and  the memory  device  to  the
\emph{right} controller port.

The  retail  cartridge (available  later  in  2022 from  AtariAge)  will
\emph{not}  require  a  memory   device  because  the  special  AtariAge
cartridge contains its own save-game memory within it.

To purchase \textit{Grizzards}, SaveKey,  AtariVox+, or many other Atari
games,                                                             visit
\href{https://atariage.com/store/}{https://AtariAge.com/store/}

\fi\fi

Finally, insert  the \textit{Grizzards}  game cartridge (with  the label
facing  up)  into  the  cartridge  slot,  and  turn  the  \textbf{Power}
\textbf{on}.

\section{Using a Gamepad}\label{sec:Gamepad}

  A  SEGA  Genesis/MegaDrive   gamepad  (or  other
compatible controller) may also be  used. Use the \encircle{B} button as
the \textbf{Fire} button. Use the  \encircle{C} button as an alternative
way  to   press  the   \textbf{Game  Select}   switch  to   access  your
Grizzard's statistics.

A ``Joy2b$^+$'' game pad, such as those from 
\href{https://retrogameboyz.com/products/atari-8-bit-2-button-action-joystick-control-pad-gamepad-xegs-theme?variant=39665422565431}{RetroGameBoyz.com},
can also  be used.  Button \encircle{I} will  work as  the \textbf{Fire}
button.  Button  \encircle{II} will  work  as  the \textbf{Game  Select}
switch. Button \encircle{III} will toggle pausing the game.

An    Atari     7800    controller     will    \emph{not}     work    as
a two-button controller, even on an Atari 7800 console.

Your gamepad  \emph{must} be  plugged in \emph{before}  you turn  on the
power, or the extra  buttons will not work. \ifdefined\ATARIAGESAVE\else
If using a \ifdefined\DEMO Harmony or \fi Harmony Encore cartridge, hold
down  the \encircle{B}  or \encircle{I}  button when  you power  on your
console, or the gamepad will not work on the Harmony menu. \fi

\twocolumn[\chapter{How To Play}]

\section{Console Controls}

\subsection{Pausing the Game}

On an Atari 2600  (or similar console), with the NTSC  or PAL version of
the game,  push the  \textbf{Color/B\&W} switch into  the \textbf{Color}
position  to play  the game,  or  the \textbf{B\&W}  position to  pause.

With the SECAM  version of the game, the Right  Difficulty Switch can be
used  to  pause game  play.  When  in  the  ``A'' (Advanced  or  Expert)
position, your  game will be paused.

On the  Atari 7800, press  the \textbf{Pause}  button once to  pause the
game, and again to resume playing. \ifdefined\ATARIAGESAVE\else This may
not work with certain multi-carts, e.g. the UnoCart or PlusCart. \fi

\subsection{Game Select}

When viewing  the Title Screen,  use the \textbf{Game Select}  switch to
\ifdefined\NOSAVE begin your game or start  over \else choose a Slot and
begin or resume a game. \fi

While you  are playing the  game, use the  \textbf{Game Select}
switch to view your Grizzard's  statistics.

\subsection{Game Reset}

When  viewing the  Select  Slot screen,  press  the \textbf{Game  Reset}
switch to begin playing the game.

While you are playing the game,  press the \textbf{Game Reset} switch to
\emph{immediately} abandon your progress and return to the Title Screen.
You will  lose some  of your  progress since the  last time  you visited
a Grizzard Depot.

\ifdefined\NOSAVE\else

\subsection{Protecting Your Game Record}

You  cannot erase  a  game  in progress  (or  un-erase  it) unless  both
Difficulty  Switches are  in the  ``A'' (Advanced  or Expert)  position.
To protect your game from being erased, set either one of the Difficulty
Switches to the ``B'' (Beginner or Novice) position.

\fi

\subsubsection*{Expert Mode}

The Left Difficulty Switch adjusts the  difficulty of the game. When the
Left Difficulty  Switch is in  the ``A'' (Advanced or  Expert) position,
monsters will do more damage in their attacks. You will also earn double
points for defeating monsters while in the ``A'' position.

On the Atari 7800, the  Difficulty Switches (located near the controller
ports) are in the ``A'' position when they are moved to the right.

\section{Starting a Game}

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=.75\columnwidth]{../Manual/TitleAquaxNTSC.png}
\end{center}

Once your  console is set  up and everything  is connected, turn  on the
\textbf{Power} switch. You'll  see the title screen appear.  If you have
an AtariVox device, you'll also hear the title spoken.

Press the \textbf{Game Select} switch or \textbf{Fire} button to move to
the
\ifdefined\NOSAVE
Begin/Resume screen.

Press the  joystick left or  right to choose whether  to \texttt{RESUME}
your current game  in progress or \texttt{BEGIN} a new  game, then press
\textbf{Game Reset} or the \textbf{Fire} button.

\else
Select Slot screen.

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=.75\columnwidth]{../Manual/SelectSlotNTSC.png}
\end{center}

Press  the \textbf{Game  Select} switch  or move  the joystick  left and
right to  choose a  memory slot\ifdefined\ATARIAGESAVE\else\footnote{The
  Slot number chosen here is relative  to the three save game slots used
  by the \textit{Grizzards}  game program. Each save  game slot actually
  occupies  4  blocks  on  your  memory  device.}\fi{}  for  your  game.
There  are \ifdefined\ATARIAGESAVE  eight \else  three \fi  memory slots
available.

If someone  has already  begun to play  \textit{Grizzards} in  a certain
slot, your screen will show  \texttt{RESUME}, and their name will appear
as well. If a slot is empty, you'll see \texttt{BEGIN} instead.

If someone has already \emph{won} the  game once, their name will appear
in bright yellow. See ``New Game Plus,'' page~\pageref{sec:NewGamePlus}.

\ifdefined\DEMO

\skip

Your save game progress from the demo is \emph{not} transferable to the
full game.

\skip

\fi

When you have selected the slot in which to begin (or resume), press the
\textbf{Fire} button.

\fi

\ifdefined\NOSAVE\else

When you begin a  new game, enter your name. Push  forward to select the
next letter;  pull back to  select the  previous letter. Press  left and
right to move to  the previous or next position. You can  use up to six
characters for  your name.  After six characters,  the cursor  will turn
pink; then, press the \textbf{Fire} button to proceed.

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=.75\columnwidth]{../Manual/NameEntryNTSC.png}
\end{center}

\ifdefined\DEMO

In this demo,  you'll always begin with Aquax as  your companion. In the
full game, you can choose from one of three starting Grizzard companions.

\else

Next, you'll pick your starting Grizzard. There are three Grizzards from
which    to    choose:   Dirtex,    Aquax,    or    Airex.   Refer    to
Chapter~\ref{ch:Grizzards}   on  page~\pageref{ch:Grizzards}   for  more
information about each of them.

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=.75\columnwidth]{../Manual/GrizzardChooserNTSC.png}
\end{center}

Press left  and right  to choose  a Grizzard  companion, then  press the
\textbf{Fire} button.

Make  sure  that you've  entered  your  name  correctly and  chosen  the
Grizzard companion  you prefer. Push  forward on the joystick  to select
\texttt{CHANGE} and edit your name and companion choice, or pull back to
choose    to   \texttt{BEGIN}    your   adventure    now.   Press    the
\textbf{Fire} button.

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=.75\columnwidth]{../Manual/ConfirmNewGameNTSC.png}
\end{center}

\fi
\fi
\ifdefined\NOSAVE

In this no-save demo, you can only  play with one Grizzard at a time ---
starting with Aquax. The demo using  a memory device allows you to catch
other Grizzards. In the full game,  you can choose one of three starting
Grizzard companions.

\fi

\section{Exploring Syrex}

You'll begin in the ruins of  Treble Village after the monsters invaded.
You know that to  the east is the extremely dangerous  Fire Bog, so your
best  bet   is  to  head   west  (left)  and   see  if  there   are  any
other survivors.

The Map screen shows your current score  at the top. In the map display,
you'll see the  current area in which you are  traveling. Guide yourself
using the joystick.

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=.75\columnwidth]{../Manual/MapNTSC.png}
\end{center}

Refer to \ifdefined\ATARIAGESAVE  the included map \else the  map on the
last page  of this  manual \fi  to learn about  the geography  of Syrex.
Characters in the game will also give you advice.

You can check your inventory of potions,  and choose to give one to your
current  Grizzard  companion  by   pressing  the  \textbf{Fire}  button.
\ifdefined\DEMO However, there are no potions in this demo. \fi

To interact with something on the Map screen, just walk into it.

\section{Battling Monsters}

% \begin{figure*}[t]
%   \begin{center}
%     \includegraphics[width=2\columnwidth]{../Manual/CombatControls.eps}
%   \end{center}
% \end{figure*}

Monsters have  begun to plague the  world of Syrex. If  you're caught by
monsters,  your Grizzard  companion  must defend  you.  You'll see  this
Combat display.

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=.75\columnwidth]{../Manual/MonsterCombatNTSC.png}
\end{center}

Monsters often  travel in groups, so  you may see more  than one monster
facing you.  When it's the  monsters' turn, the  top part of  the screen
will be red (white on SECAM).

When  it's your  turn,  the  bottom part  of  the  screen, showing  your
Grizzard, will be indigo (magenta on SECAM).

The long bar beneath your Grizzard represents its hit points.

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=.6667\columnwidth]{../Manual/GrizzardCombatNTSC.png}
\end{center}

Push the joystick forward and back to select a Move from those that your
Grizzard knows how to perform. Those  your Grizzard knows will appear in
light blue. If your Grizzard does \emph{not} know a Move, it will appear
in black.

To view your Grizzard's statistics, press \textbf{Game Select}.

Most Moves will target a monster. Press left or right on the joystick to
select a target. Some Moves instead affect your Grizzard itself.

When   you   have   chosen   a    Move   and   a   target,   press   the
\textbf{Fire} button.

\begin{figure*}[b]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=2\columnwidth,height=\columnwidth]{../Manual/GrizzardCombat.png}
  \end{center}
\end{figure*}


\subsection{Performing a Move}

After a Move has been performed,  the creature targeted by that move may
be injured  (lose hit points)  and/or have a  Status Effect\footnote{See
  page~\pageref{sec:StatusEffects} to learn  about Status Effects} added
to  it. Status  Effects  are temporary  and last  only  the duration  of
one battle.

It's possible for a move to miss its target. If that happens, you'll see
\texttt{MISSED} appear  briefly. It's also  possible to have  a critical
success.  That move  will do  double the  usual damage,  and you'll  see
\texttt{CRIT!} appear on the screen.

If your Grizzard companion loses hit points, the bar below your Grizzard
will reduce in  length. If your Grizzard is defeated,  the monsters will
surely eat you! Your adventure will end there. \ifdefined\NOSAVE You can
resume your game from the Begin/Resume  screen, or start over. \else You
can continue from  the last Grizzard Depot you visited  by selecting the
same game slot on the Select Slot screen. \fi

If you  defeat all of  the monsters, victory  is yours! Your  score will
increase,  and you'll  return  to  the Map  screen.  You  may also  find
a potion was  left behind by the monsters. \ifdefined\DEMO  There are no
potions in the demo. \fi

% You  may choose  to run  away from  a fight,  but the  monsters will  be
% immediately healed and may still come after you.

\subsection{Grizzard Learning}

Your  Grizzard companion  may  learn from  opposing  Monsters. This  can
result in your Grizzard increasing its Attack or Defend ability, maximum
hit points, or learning a new  Move. Sometimes, your Grizzard will learn
a Move  by seeing a monster  perform it. Other times,  your Grizzard may
learn  it on  their own.  Your Grizzard  can only  learn certain  Moves.
Moves that your Grizzard does \emph{not} yet know, but is able to learn,
will appear in black.

\section{Statistics}

Press  the \textbf{Game  Select}  switch\footnote{You can  also use  the
  \encircle{C}    or     \encircle{II}    button    on     a    gamepad.
  See page~\pageref{sec:Gamepad}.} while viewing the Map, Combat screen,
or at  a Grizzard Depot  to view  your Grizzard's statistics.  Press the
\textbf{Fire} button to dismiss the Statistics screen.

At  the top  of the  Statistics screen  is a  portrait of  your Grizzard
companion, their name,  and their unique number. There  are 30 Grizzards
to catch. Can you catch them all?

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=.75\columnwidth]{../Manual/StatsScreenshotNTSC.png}
\end{center}

\begin{rdescribe}
  
\item[\texttt{ATK.}] is  the Grizzard's  \emph{Attack} ability.  This is
  the likelihood  that your Grizzard will  hit and cause damage  when it
  attacks a monster. Some Moves cause more damage than others.
  
\item[\texttt{DEF.}] is  the Grizzard's  \emph{Defend} ability.  This is
  how likely your Grizzard is to avoid being hurt by a monster's Move.

\item[\texttt{HP}]  is  the  Grizzard's  \emph{hit  points}  or  health.
  When  monsters hit  your Grizzard,  this  value will  decrease. If  it
  reaches zero, your game is over.

\item[\texttt{MAX}]  is   the  Grizzard's  \emph{maximum   hit  points}.
  Your Grizzard can only gain hit points up to this amount.
  
\end{rdescribe}

The Attack  ability, Defend  ability, or  Maximum Hit  Points may  go up
a bit after you defeat a party of monsters. Grizzards will advance their
statistics  faster  at   first,  then  more  slowly   as  they  increase
their abilities.

If you are currently in a  combat encounter, there may be Status Effects
that could change the effectiveness  of your Moves. These are \emph{not}
displayed on the Statistics screen.

\section{Status Effects}\label{sec:StatusEffects}

A Move can affect its target with Status Effects. There are six possible
Status Effects:

\begin{rdescribe}
\item[\texttt{SLEEP}] A  creature cannot  move on their turn.  There is
  a 50\% chance of waking up.
\item[\texttt{ATK UP} / \texttt{ATK DN}] Raises or lowers the creature's
  effective Attack ability.
\item[\texttt{DEF UP} / \texttt{DEF DN}] Raises or lowers the creature's
  effective Defend ability.
\item[\texttt{MUDDLE}]  A  creature will  choose  its  Moves at  random.
  There is a 50\% chance of clearing its mind.
\end{rdescribe}

These status  effects last only  the duration  of one battle.  They also
\emph{cannot} be stacked. For example: Once your attack has been raised,
it cannot be raised further.

\section{Scoring}

When you defeat a monster, you'll  earn points. The number of points you
earn will increase  as you defeat more difficult monsters.  You can also
earn points for some other actions you take in the game.

The score earned can be increased by:

\begin{ritemize}
\item \ldots{}playing  in Expert  mode (by  setting the  Left Difficulty
  Switch to the ``A'' position).
\item \ldots{}defeating the larger ``boss'' version of a monster.
\item  \ldots{}playing the  game  in  New Game  Plus  mode after  having
  defeated the final boss.
\end{ritemize}

The score for  defeating a monster will be increased  to $2\times$ for any
one of these  factors, to $3\times$ for  any two of these  factors, and to
$4\times$ if all three are true.

\section{Winning the Game}

You can  win the  game by  discovering what dark  forces are  behind the
onslaught of so many monsters, and defeating them.

You'll  be rewarded  with  a  special screen  when  you've defeated  the
final boss, showing  your name, score, and the number  of Grizzards that
have joined you.

\subsection*{New Game Plus}\label{sec:NewGamePlus}

Once  you've won  the game,  you can  keep playing!  On the  screen that
appears when you win, press \textbf{Game  Reset} on your console to save
your progress and create a ``new game, plus.''

You'll gain both  of the starting Grizzards that you  had not chosen the
first time, as well as all  your trained Grizzards. Monsters will become
more difficult — but also yield more points when defeated.


\section{Game Over}

If  you fail  in  your mission,  your  game is  over.  However, you  can
continue. You'll start over from  \ifdefined\NOSAVE the beginning of the
game, with your current progress. \else the last Grizzard Depot that you
had visited. \fi

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=.75\columnwidth]{../Manual/GameOverNTSC.png}
\end{center}

\section{Starting Over}\label{Starting Your Adventure Over}

\ifdefined\NOSAVE

When  you  start  the  game,  you can  \texttt{BEGIN}  a  new  game,  or
\texttt{RESUME}  your existing  game.  If  you begin  a  new game,  your
previous progress will be erased.

\else

If you want to erase your progress and start again, you must:

\begin{ritemize}
\item Go  to the Select Slot  screen, and press \textbf{Game  Select} or
  move  the joystick  left and  right until  you see  the slot  you want
  to erase.
\item Set both  of the Difficulty Switches on your  console to the ``A''
  (Advanced or Expert) position.
\item Pull  back on the  joystick, and \emph{while holding  the joystick
    back} press \emph{and hold} the \textbf{Fire} button.
\item If you're \emph{sure} you want to erase your game's progress, then
  \emph{without}  letting  go  of  the \textbf{Fire}  button,  push  the
  joystick  forward. \ifdefined\DEMO  Your  game record  will be  erased
  \emph{immediately}. \fi
\end{ritemize}

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=.75\columnwidth]{../Manual/EraseSlotNTSC.png}
\end{center}

\ifdefined\DEMO

\emph{Once your game record has been  erased, you cannot recover it, so
  think carefully before you erase it.}

\else

Make sure  you want to  erase your game.  Press the joystick  forward or
back to make your choice, and press the \textbf{Fire} button.

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=.75\columnwidth]{../Manual/ConfirmEraseNTSC.png}
\end{center}

\fi

The Left  Difficulty Switch is also  used to increase the  difficulty of
the  game.  After  erasing  your  progress,  you  may  return  the  Left
Difficulty  Switch  to  your  desired position.  (On  SECAM,  the  Right
Difficulty Switch is used to pause the game.)

\subsection{Protecting Your Game Record}

You  cannot erase  a  game  in progress  (or  un-erase  it) unless  both
Difficulty  Switches are  in the  ``A'' (Advanced  or Expert)  position.
To protect your game from being erased, set either one of the Difficulty
Switches to the ``B'' (Beginner or Novice) position.

\ifdefined\DEMO\else

\subsection{Recovering an Erased Game}

If you have \emph{just} erased a game's progress, and no one has started
a new game using the same slot yet, you may be able to un-erase it.

To recover  an erased game,  follow the same steps  as if you  wanted to
erase  a game.  Press  left and  right  on the  joystick  to select  the
now-empty slot (the screen will say \texttt{BEGIN}). Set both Difficulty
Switches to  the ``A'' (Advanced or  Expert) position. Pull back  on the
joystick,  and \emph{while  holding the  joystick back}  press \emph{and
  hold} the \textbf{Fire} button.

If your  game's progress can be  recovered, you'll see that  the slot is
\texttt{ERASED} with your name. Press  forward on the joystick. The game
will immediately become available to resume.

It is \emph{not possible} to recover  a saved game's progress once a new
game has been started in the same memory slot. If you accidentally start
a new  game, but have  not confirmed your  name yet, \emph{turn  off the
  power briefly}, then try the preceding recovery steps..

\chapter{Grizzards and Moves}\label{ch:Grizzards}

There are  30 Grizzards in  the game world,  each with their  own unique
starting attributes and  sets of Moves. \ifdefined\NOSAVE  In this demo,
you  can play  with only  one Grizzard  at a  time. Other  Grizzards are
available  with  a memory  device  or  the  retail cartridge.  \fi  Each
Grizzard is able to learn eight different Moves, in addition to the move
\texttt{RUN AWAY}. It's up to you  to discover which Moves each Grizzard
is able to learn.

\section{Metamorphosis}

Many Grizzards  can metamorphose into a  new form when they  have gained
a certain  amount of experience. The  new Grizzard may be  able to learn
different Moves and have improved statistics.


% When you begin your adventure, you can choose one of the following three
% Grizzards as your initial companion.

\begin{ritemize}
\item \texttt{MILD SHOCK} --- shocks  the enemy with static electricity,
  causing some damage.
\item \texttt{WIND FIGHT} --- causes a bit more damage than \texttt{MILD SHOCK}.
\item \texttt{STEAL ATTACK} --- may lower the enemy's Attack ability.
\item \texttt{STEAL DEFEND} --- may lower the enemy's Defend ability.
\item \texttt{STEAL TURN} --- may put the enemy to sleep.
\end{ritemize}

When Airex gains enough experience, it will metamorphose into Flyer.

\section{Healing}

Most Grizzards can learn healing Moves as well. Some examples:

\begin{ritemize}
\item \texttt{FIRST AID} --- heals a small amount of health.
\item \texttt{SIMPLE CURE} --- heals a bit larger amount of health.
\item \texttt{COMMON CURE} --- heals even more health.
\end{ritemize}

You can also heal your Grizzard  by visiting a Grizzard Depot, or giving
them a Potion. To use a  potion, press the \textbf{Fire} button while on
the Map screen. You cannot use a potion during a battle. \ifdefined\DEMO
There are no potions in this demo. \fi

\section{Running Away}

The  Move \texttt{RUN  AWAY}  lets  you try  to  escape  from a  battle.
Your  Grizzard will  \emph{not}  be  healed if  you  run  away, but  the
monsters that you were facing will be healed immediately.

Certain  monsters  are too  terrifying  to  escape. When  you  encounter
a ``boss'' monster like this, it will  be a duel to the death. Watch out
for their unique shape on the map screen.
