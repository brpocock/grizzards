\chapter{Introduction}

Long ago,  the world was  troubled by  monsters. The Three  Sages united
their powers at the temples to protect the villages of Aclypt.

The Sage Uron in the Temple of  the Sea protected the rivers, lakes, and
beaches  from  sea monsters.  The  Sage  Eril  in  the Temple  of  Lands
protected from  monsters on the ground.  The Sage Ybor in  the Temple of
the Sky protected from flying monsters.

For many  years this magic has  protected Aclypt. Your village  of Hapri
has been safe and quiet your entire life.

Recently, though, a traveler named  Ferris reached your village from the
nearby town  of Albron. He  tells you that  Albron is being  attacked by
monsters from the nearby forest  of Prulin. Your village's elder, Roton,
has chosen you to go to Albron and help protect them.

Your mission  is to  defend Albron,  and then  continue onward  into the
greater  world to  the Temple  of Lands  to see  why its  power did  not
protect Albron.

\chapter{Setting Up}

To play Grizzards, you will need:

\begin{itemize}
\item An Atari 2600 Video Computer System or Atari 7800 ProSystem
\item A TV or video display
\item A joystick controller
\item An AtariVox device with (optional) speakers or headphones
\item The Grizzards game cartridge
\end{itemize}

Set up your  Atari Video Computer System or ProSystem  with your TV or
video  display.  Connect  a  joystick controller  to  the  \emph{left}
controller  port,   and  the  AtariVox  device   to  the  \emph{right}
controller port.  Make certain  that the  Power switch  is in  the Off
position.

Finally, insert the Grizzards game cartridge with the
label facing up into the cartridge slot, and turn the Power On.

\section{Controller Ports}

Your joystick  connects to the  left controller port, and  your AtariVox
device connects to the right controller port.

If your AtariVox is missing, you'll see a red Sad Face screen.

Always   turn  Off   the  Power   switch  before   adding  or   removing
your AtariVox.

This  game  saves  your  progress   to  the  AtariVox  while  you  play.
Always return to the Title Screen  by pressing Game Reset before turning
Off the Power to be sure your game record is not damaged.

\section{Console Controls}

\subsection{Color/B\&W Switch (Pause)}

The Color/B\&W switch on the Atari  2600 Video Computer System, or the
Pause button  on the Atari 7800  ProSystem, can be used  to pause your
game. Push  the control into the  Color position to play,  or the B\&W
position to pause the game.

\subsection{Game Select}

When viewing the Title Screen, you can use the Game Select switch to
choose the Slot you wish to use.  See Getting Started on page
\ref{Getting Started} for details.

\subsection{Game Reset}

When viewing  the Select  Slot screen,  press the  Game Reset  switch to
begin playing the  game. While you are playing the  game, press the Game
Reset switch to save your place and return to the Title Screen.

\subsection{Difficulty Switches}

In order to erase your game progress information, both Difficulty
Switches must be moved to the A (Expert) position.

To protect  against accidentally erasing  your game record, you  can set
the right Difficulty Switch to the B (Novice) position.

While  you  are playing,  the  Difficulty  Switches  have no  effect  on
game play. 

\chapter{Getting Started}\label{Getting Started}

When you first turn on Grizzards, you'll see the Title
Screen. To begin playing, press the Game Select switch.

In  Grizzards,  your game  progress is  recorded on  your
AtariVox  device. You  have  a choice  of 3  ``slots''  so that  three
different players  can use  the same AtariVox  device to  record their
progress.

Press Game Select to choose one of the three slots, then press Game
Reset.

If you've started an adventure in a slot, you'll see that the word
``RESUME'' appears on your screen. If that slot is empty, you'll
instead see the word ``BEGIN.''

\section{Resuming Your Progress}

When you leave the game, either by pressing Game Reset or reaching a
``GAME OVER,'' your progress will automatically be saved on your
AtariVox. Your progress is also saved at certain points in the story.

At first, when you resume the game, you'll return to your home village
of Hapri. Throughout the game, however, you may encounter certain
characters who will ``bless'' you. From that point on, your play will
resume at the place where you were last blessed.

\section{Starting Your Adventure Over}\label{Starting Your Adventure Over}

When you choose a slot with no game record in it already, you'll begin
a new adventure in your home village of Hapri.

If you want to delete your adventure and start again in Hapri, it's a
little bit tricky. This is to make sure you don't accidentally lose
your progress!

From the Title Screen, press Game Select. Then, press Game Select
until the slot you want to erase is shown.

Here's the tricky part. You'll need to:

\begin{itemize}
\item Make sure that both of the Difficulty Switches on your console
  are set to the ``A'' or ``Expert'' position.
\item With your joystick controller, pull down (toward you) on the
  joystick and hold down the Fire button.
\end{itemize}

The screen will change from saying ``SELECT SLOT'' to saying ``ERASE
SLOT.'' The text will also be red to catch your attention.

If you're sure you want to erase your game data, then \emph{without}
letting go of the Fire button, move the joystick up (toward the
TV). You'll see that the slot changes from IN USE to VACANT
immediately.

Once your game record has been erased, there's no way to get it back,
so think carefully before you erase it.

\subsection{Protecting Your Game Record}

If the Right  Difficulty Switch is in the B  (Novice) position, then you
can't  erase a  game slot.  When you  connect your  AtariVox, check  the
position of that switch.

If your AtariVox is missing, you'll see a red Sad Face screen.

Always   turn  Off   the  Power   switch  before   adding  or   removing
your AtariVox.

This game saves your progress to the AtariVox while you play.  Always
return to the Title Screen by pressing Game Reset before turning Off
the Power to be sure your game record is not damaged.


\chapter{Interacting With the Game}

Your adventure will take the form of three types of actions:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Moving around the game world on the Map Screen.
\item Speaking with other characters in the game world on the
  Conversation Screen.
\item Fighting off monsters on the Battle Screen.
\end{enumerate}

\section{The Map Screen}

The Map Screen is where you navigate the world of Aclypt. You'll
encounter different types of terrain in different provinces of the
world, but you'll get around in the same way.

To walk around the world, press the joystick controller in the
direction you'd like to travel.

As you travel, you may encounter other characters, special items, and
monsters. To interact with them, simply walk up to them until you
touch.

Monsters can be very sneaky. You may not always see monsters
approaching.

Certain obstacles in the game world may prevent you from going past
them if you do not have the proper item.

\section{The Conversation Screen}

When you encounter other characters in the game world, they will often
have something to say to you.

You'll see the name of the character and a small portrait of what they
look like. Their speech will come to you from your AtariVox speakers
or headphones.

If you want someone to repeat themself, press the joystick controller
up (toward the TV).

When you're  done speaking to  someone, their portrait will  remain on
the screen for a short time to allow you to ask for a repeat.

When you're through speaking to someone, you can press the Fire button
to return to the Map Screen.

Some people  may react differently to  you if you have  information to
share with them, or an item that  they want. If someone asks you to do
them a favor, make sure you return to them. There may be a reward!

\subsection{Some Useful Friends}

When you begin your adventure in Hapri, you should look for someone
named Chenal. When you speak to him, he'll tell you: ``You should
speak to my friend Alev in Albron. He is a mage who might teach you
the spell Abara Dabra.''

After you've spoken to Chenal, and have journeyed to Albron, seek out
Alev. He'll be so delighted to hear from Chenal that he'll teach you
the spell, but he won't explain what it does.

If you return to Hapri, you can ask Chenal and he'll explain what
Abraca Dabra will do.

Another useful friend in Hapri is Seed. She will heal you of any
injuries from your battles.

\section{The Battle Screen}

Once a peaceful kingdom, some parts of Aclypt are now riddled with
dangerous monsters.

You can approach a monster that you see on the Map Screen and start a
battle with them by running into the monster. Even though you might
only see one monster on the Map Screen, there may be more than one
traveling together. You can avoid these battles by not touching the
monster on the Map Screen.

Sometimes, though, monsters may sneak up on you. You can encounter
monsters in dangerous territories without ever having seen them. These
battles cannot be avoided.

In a normal battle, you'll see one or more monsters at the top of your
screen, along with the name of the monster type.

\subsection{On the Monsters' Turn}

When it's the monsters' turn to attack, you'll see only the monsters
on your screen.

The monsters may attack you. If they succeed, you'll lose an amount of
energy. Improving your shield will protect you from more attacks, and
reduce the amount of damage the monsters do.

If you run out of energy, your game is over. Don't worry, though ---
you can still resume your adventure from the Title Screen.

\subsection{On Your Turn}

At the bottom of the Battle Screen are four icons, which you can use
to pick your strategy.

Press up on the joystick controller to use your bow \& arrows to shoot
at the monsters. Press left to use your sword. Press right to use a
magic spell (if you know any). Pull down on the joystick to try to run
away.

When you've chosen your strategy, press the Fire button to proceed.

If you're using your sword, or bow \& arrows, you'll have to choose
which monster you'll attack. Press the joystick to select a monster,
then press the Fire button.

If you're using a magic spell, you'll see your magic scroll. Press up
and down on the joystick controller to choose the name of the magic
spell you want to use, then press the Fire button to select it.

If you hurt a monster, you'll see the amount of damage that you did on
the   screen  briefly.   Once   a  monster   is   defeated,  it   will
disappear. When all of the  monsters have been defeated, you'll return
to the Map Screen.

\section{Scoring}

When you  defeat a monster, you'll  earn points. The number  of points
you earn will increase as you defeat more difficult monsters.

Your score begins at 000000 when you start your adventure.

As your score  increases, lower level monsters will learn  to fear you
and flee. You'll have less encounters with these monsters.

\chapter{Game Over}

If you fail in your mission, your game is over. However, you have
another chance to continue.

When you continue, it'll be just as if you'd never failed in the first
place. However, you'll start over from a safe place. If you fail early
in the game, you'll return to Hapri to continue your adventure. Later,
you'll find that you can be blessed by certain characters in the
game. You'll return to the last place you were Blessed if you fail.

Just choose your game slot from the Title Screen to resume your
adventure.

\chapter{Troubleshooting}

\section{Sad Face Screen}

If you see the Sad Face screen, the game is trying to tell you that
there is a problem.

From here, you can press the Game Reset switch to return to the Title
Screen. 

\subsection{Red Sad Face Screen}

The red sad  face screen means that your AtariVox  device was not found. 
Turn off your Atari and connect an AtariVox to the right controller port. 
You may plug in speakers or headphones to your AtariVox so that you can hear
the game voices.

\subsection{White Sad Face Screen}

The white sad  face screen means that the game  has encountered an error and
cannot continue.  Please contact
\href{mailto:support@star-hope.org}{support@star-hope.org} for additional
assistance.

\subsection{Bar Code Information}

The bottom half of the screen will show some bar coded information
that describes the state of your Atari when the game stopped
working. If you can take a clear photo of this bar code, it can
sometimes help the programmers to diagnose the problem.

\section{TV goes blank when saving}

Make sure your AtariVox is connected. If your AtariVox is not
connected when the game tries to save, you may see the TV picture
remain blank while the game tries to record your progress. Just plug
in the AtariVox to the right controller port and your game should be
saved.

The game saves at various times while you play, as well as when you
press the Game Reset switch, so it's best to leave the AtariVox
connected all the time. (Besides, you won't be able to hear what
anyone says if you unplug it!)

\section{No voices}

Make sure that you have speakers plugged in to your AtariVox
device. When the game first starts the title screen, after a brief
pause, you'll hear the AtariVox announce the name of the game. If you
don't, make sure that the AtariVox is connected and the speakers are
connected, powered on, and turned up.

\chapter{Technical Notes}

The following notes are of interest to hackers only. You don't need to
understand anything in this section to play Grizzards.

\section{Game Record Slots}

There are 3 logical game slots that you can choose from for the
game. Each save game slot takes up 4 blocks (256 bytes) of storage
space on your AtariVox memory card. The following blocks are used:

\begin{enumeration}
\item Slot 1 uses memory blocks $58-$5b (addresses $1600-$16ff)
\item Slot 2 uses memory blocks $5c-$5f (addresses $1700-$17ff)
\item Slot 3 uses memory blocks $60-$63 (addresses $1800-$18ff)
\end{enumeration}

TODO --- The memory footprint might be reduced in future.

\subsection{Registration}

TODO --- register these allocations with AtariAge (
https://atariage.com/atarivox/atarivox\_mem\_list.html )

Then the following will become true:

The addresses used by the Save Game Slots are registered with
AtariAge, so they won't conflict with any other games you might play.

\subsection{Portability}

The save game records are in the same format for all \emph{Grizzards} game
cartridges, regardless of the region for which they were saved.  This means
that you can save your progress on an NTSC type system and then continue
playing on a PAL or SECAM system, or vice-versa.

\subsection{Volatility}

The save game format may change during development. Since this is an
``alpha'' quality game, it's possible that the final release may not
be able to read your saved game record.

When the final game is released, you may need to start over by erasing
your game record. See Starting Your Adventure Over on page
\ref{Starting Your Adventure Over} for instructions on erasing your
game record.
