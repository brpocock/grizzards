\chapter*{Introduction}\label{Introduction}

The  land of  Syrex  is  a dangerous  place.  Fierce  monsters roam  the
countryside. But luckily for you, you're a Grizzard handler!

Train your Grizzard to  use a variety of moves to  take on the monsters.
Discover new kinds  of Grizzards with new capabilities.  Can you conquer
all the monsters of Syrex?

\bigskip

In the  \textit{Grizzards} videogame, you'll  roam the land  looking for
monsters. Monsters may  surprise you as you travel, or  you may see them
coming. When faced  with terrifying beasts, you'll  direct your Grizzard
to use its moves to defend you and attack the monsters.

\twocolumn[ \chapter{Setting Up}\label{Setting Up} ]

To play \textit{Grizzards}, you will need:

\begin{itemize}
\item An Atari  console: the Atari Video Computer  System CX-2600, Sears
  Tele-Games  Video Arcade,  Atari  2600jr game  system,  or Atari  7800
  ProSystem
\item A TV or video display
\item A joystick controller
  \ifdefined\ATARIAGESAVE
  \item Optional: an AtariVox device with speakers or headphones
  \else
  \ifdefined\NOSAVE\else
\item A  memory device: an  AtariVox device with (optional)  speakers or
  headphones, or a MemCard or SaveKey device.
  \fi\fi
\item The \textit{Grizzards} game cartridge \ifdefined\ATARIAGESAVE\else
  or a multi-cart with the \textit{Grizzards} data on it \fi
\end{itemize}

  \end{center}
\end{figure*}
\fi

Set up your console with your TV or video display. Connect a joystick to
the \emph{left} controller port\ifdefined\ATARIAGESAVE, and (optionally)
your   AtariVox   device   to    the   \emph{right}   controller   port.
\else\ifdefined\NOSAVE.\else{},   and   the   memory   device   to   the
\emph{right} controller port.

Note that the  retail cartridge available from  AtariAge does \emph{not}
require a memory device because  the special AtariAge cartridge contains
its own save-game memory within it.

To  purchase  \textit{Grizzards}  or   many  other  Atari  games,  visit
\href{https://atariage.com/}{https://atariage.com/}

  number chosen  here is relative to  the three save game  slots used by
  the  \textit{Grizzards} game  program.  Each save  game slot  actually
  occupies 4 blocks on your memory  device.}\fi for your game. There are
\ifdefined\ATARIAGESAVE  four \else  three  \fi  memory slots  possible.
Press \textbf{Game Select} or the joystick again to rotate through them.
If someone  has already  begun to play  \textit{Grizzards} in  a certain
slot, your  screen will  show ``\texttt{RESUME},''  and their  name will
appear    as    well.    If    a   slot    is    empty,    you'll    see
``\texttt{BEGIN}'' instead.

If someone has already \emph{won} the  game once, their name will appear
in bright yellow. See New Game Plus, page~\pageref{sec:NewGamePlus}.

\ifdefined\DEMO

\skip

This demo saves your progress in  the ``scratchpad'' area of your memory
device. It's possible that other  games might overwrite and destroy your
saved progress.  This is  just because  it's a demo,  and does  not have
a private area reserved for it.

\skip

\fi

When you have selected the slot you want to begin (or resume), press the
\textbf{Game Reset} switch or \textbf{Fire} button.

\fi

\ifdefined\NOSAVE\else

When you  first choose  to begin a  new game, you  can enter  your name.
Press  forward to  select  the  next letter;  pull  back  to select  the
previous letter.  Press left and right  to move to the  next or previous
position. You  can have up  to six characters  for your name.  After six

  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{../Manual/NameEntry\TV.png}
\end{center}

\ifdefined\DEMO

In this demo,  you'll always begin with Aquax as  your companion. In the
full game, you can choose from one of three starting Grizzard companions.

\else

Next,  you'll  get to  pick  your  starting  Grizzard. There  are  three
Grizzards  from which  to  choose:  Dirtex, Aquax,  or  Airex. Refer  to
Chapter~\ref{ch:Grizzards}   on  page~\pageref{ch:Grizzards}   for  more

\fi
\fi
\ifdefined\NOSAVE

In this no-save demo, you can only  play with one Grizzard at a time ---
starting with Aquax. The demo using  a memory device allows you to catch
other Grizzards. In the full game,  you can choose one of three starting
Grizzard companions.

\fi

\section{Exploring Syrex}

You'll begin in the ruins of  Treble Village after the monsters invaded.
You know that to  the east is the extremely dangerous  Fire Bog, so your
best  bet   is  to  head   west  (left)  and   see  if  there   are  any
other survivors.

Refer to the  map (back cover of  this manual) for some  ideas about the
geography of  Syrex. Other  characters in  the game  will also  give you
advice about places you can go and things you can do.

The Map screen shows your current score  at the top. In the map display,
you'll see the  current area in which you are  traveling. Guide yourself
using the joystick.

You can check your inventory of potions,  and choose to give one to your
current  Grizzard  companion  by   pressing  the  \textbf{Fire}  button.
\ifdefined\DEMO However, there are no potions in this demo. \fi

\fi \fi

\section{Grizzard Depots}\label{sec:GrizzardDepot}

To \ifdefined\NOSAVE\else  swap which  Grizzard you're using,  or to  \fi heal
your current Grizzard companion, you'll need to find a Grizzard Depot.

\begin{figure*}[hb]
  \begin{center}

  \end{center}
\end{figure*}

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{../Manual/DepotScreenshot\TV.png}
\end{center}

Touch the Grizzard Depot on the map screen to enter it.

\ifdefined\NOSAVE\else Your progress will \emph{immediately} be saved to
your \ifdefined\ATARIAGESAVE  game cartridge.  \else memory  device. \fi
\fi

At  a Grizzard  Depot  your  Grizzard companion  will  be fully  healed.
\ifdefined\NOSAVE\else  Press the  joystick forward  and back  to choose
a different Grizzard to travel with you. \fi

To  view  your Grizzard's  statistics,  press  the \textbf{Game  Select}
switch or move  the joystick left or right. When  you're ready to return
to your adventure, press the \textbf{Fire} button.

\section{Conversations}

When you encounter  a person, they'll usually speak to  you. If you have
an AtariVox  connected, you'll hear  what they have  to say out  loud as
well.   After  you've   read  what   they   have  to   say,  press   the
\textbf{Fire} button.

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{../Manual/Text\TV.png}
\end{center}

Some people will want to know what you have to say, in return. If that's
the case, you'll be given a choice of two possible answers to give them.
Press forward or back on the joystick to select a response.

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{../Manual/Inquire\TV.png}
\end{center}

If  you  want to  review  what  the person  was  asking,  you can  press
left on  the joystick to  ask them to repeat  themself instead.

When you've made your selection, press \textbf{Fire} to continue.

\section{Battling Monsters}

Monsters plague the world of Syrex. If you're caught by monsters without
a  Grizzard companion,  they're sure  to  eat you  alive! Your  Grizzard
companion will defend you.

\begin{figure*}[ht]
  \includegraphics[width=2\columnwidth]{../Manual/CombatControls.png}
\end{figure*}

When you  encounter monsters, you'll  see the Combat display.  When it's
your turn, the bottom part of the screen (showing your Grizzard) will be
\ifdefined\TVSECAM magenta\else  indigo\fi{}. The long bar  beneath your
Grizzard shows its hit points.

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{../Manual/GrizzardCombat\TV.png}
\end{center}

When  it's the  monsters'  turn, the  top  part of  the  screen will  be
\ifdefined\TVSECAM white. \else red. \fi

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{../Manual/MonsterCombat\TV.png}
\end{center}

Monsters often  travel in groups, so  you may see more  than one monster
facing you.

You can choose  from the moves that your Grizzard  knows how to perform.
Press the joystick  forward and back to select a  move. If your Grizzard
knows how to perform it, it will  appear in light blue. If your Grizzard
does not yet know how, it will appear in black.

Most Moves will target one monster.  Press left or right on the joystick
to select a target. Some Moves instead affect yourself.

When   you   have   chosen   a   move  (and   a   target),   press   the
\textbf{Fire} button.

To view the statistics of your Grizzard, press \textbf{Game Select}.

\subsection{Performing a Move}

\begin{figure*}[b]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=2\columnwidth,height=\columnwidth]{../Manual/GrizzardCombat.png}
  \end{center}
\end{figure*}

After a move has been performed,  the creature targeted by that move may
be injured  (lose hit points)  and/or have a  Status Effect\footnote{See
  page~\pageref{sec:StatusEffects} to learn  about Status Effects} added
to  it. Status  Effects  are temporary  and last  only  the duration  of
one battle.

It's possible for a move to miss its target. If that happens, you'll see
\texttt{MISSED} appear  briefly. It's also  possible to have  a critical
success  ---  that  move  will  do double  the  usual  damage,  and  see
\texttt{CRIT!} appear on the screen.

If your Grizzard companion loses hit points, the bar below your Grizzard
will reduce in  length. If your Grizzard is defeated,  the monsters will
surely eat you! Your adventure will end there. \ifdefined\NOSAVE You can
resume your game from the Begin/Resume  screen, or start over. \else You
can continue from  the last Grizzard Depot you visited  by selecting the
same game slot on the Select Slot screen. \fi

If you  defeat all of  the monsters, victory  is yours! Your  score will
increase, and you'll return to the  World Map screen victorious. You may
also find a potion was left behind by the monsters. \ifdefined\DEMO\else
There are no potions in the demo. \fi

You  may choose  to run  away from  a fight,  but the  monsters will  be
immediately healed and may still come after you.

\subsection{Grizzard Learning}

Your  Grizzard companion  may  learn from  opposing  Monsters. This  can
result in your Grizzard increasing  its Attack or Defend rating, maximum
hit  points, or  learning  a Move  that a  monster  has just  performed.
Your Grizzard  can only  learn certain moves.  Moves that  your Grizzard
might be able to perform, but does not yet know, will appear in black.

\section{Statistics}

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{../Manual/StatsScreenshot\TV.png}
\end{center}

You can  press the  \textbf{Game Select} switch  while viewing  the Map,
Combat  screen,  or  at  a   Grizzard  Depot  to  view  your  Grizzard's
statistics.   Press  the   \textbf{Fire}   button  to   return  to   the
previous screen.

At  the top  of the  Statistics screen,  you'll see  a portrait  of your
Grizzard companion,  their name, and  their unique number. There  are 30
Grizzards to catch. Can you catch them all?

\begin{description}
  
\item[\texttt{ATK.}] is the Grizzard's  \emph{attack} rating. This is the
  likelihood  that your  Grizzard  will  hit and  cause  damage when  it
  attacks a monster. Some Moves cause more damage than others.
  
\item[\texttt{DEF.}] is the Grizzard's  \emph{defend} rating. This is how
  likely your Grizzard is to avoid being hurt by a monster's Move.

\item[\texttt{HP}]  is  the  Grizzard's  \emph{hit  points}  or  health.
  When  monsters hit  your Grizzard,  this  value will  decrease. If  it
  reaches zero, your game is over.

\item[\texttt{MAX}]  is   the  Grizzard's  \emph{maximum   hit  points}.
  Your Grizzard can gain more hit points up to this amount.
  
\end{description}

Each of  these statistics can  be raised up to  a maximum of  99 points.
The Attack  rating, Defend  rating, or  Maximum Hit  Points may  go up
a bit after each monster that you defeat. The more skilled your Grizzard
becomes, the less often its levels will go up.

If you are currently in a  combat encounter, there may be Status Effects
that could change the effectiveness  of your Moves. These are \emph{not}
displayed on the statistics screen.

\section{Status Effects}\label{sec:StatusEffects}

A move can affect its target with Status Effects. There are six possible
Status Effects:

\begin{description}
\item[\texttt{SLEEP}] A  creature can not  move on their turn.  There is
  a 50\% chance of waking up.
\item[\texttt{ATK UP} / \texttt{ATK DN}] Raises or lowers the creature's
  effective Attack rating.
\item[\texttt{DEF UP} / \texttt{DEF DN}] Raises or lowers the creature's
  effective Defend rating.
\item[\texttt{MUDDLE}]  A  creature will  choose  its  moves at  random.
  There is a 50\% chance of clearing its mind.
\end{description}

These status effects last only the duration of one battle.

Also, these status effects cannot be  doubled up. For example: Once your
attack has been raised, it cannot be raised further.

\section{Scoring}

When you  defeat a monster, you'll  earn points. The number  of points
you earn  will increase as you  defeat more difficult monsters.  You can
also earn points for other some other actions you take in the game.

\section{Winning the Game}

You can  win the  game by  discovering what dark  forces are  behind the
onslaught of so many monsters, and defeating them.

Once  you've won  the game,  you can  keep playing!  On the  screen that
appears when you win, press \textbf{Game  Reset} on your console to save
your winning score and create a ``new game, plus.''

On your second time through, you'll  have both of the starting Grizzards
that you  had not  chosen the first  time, as well  as all  your trained
Grizzards to choose from. Monsters will become more difficult — but also
yield more points when defeated.

\section{Game Over}

If  you fail  in  your mission,  your  game is  over.  However, you  can
continue, and it'll be just as if you'd never failed in the first place.
You'll start over from \ifdefined\NOSAVE the beginning of the game, with
your  current progress.  \else  the  last Grizzard  Depot  that you  had
visited. \fi

  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{../Manual/GameOver\TV.png}
\end{center}

\section{Starting Over}\label{Starting Your Adventure Over}

\ifdefined\NOSAVE

When  you  start  the  game,  you can  \texttt{BEGIN}  a  new  game,  or
\texttt{RESUME}  your existing  game.  If  you begin  a  new game,  your
previous progress will be erased.

\else

If you want to erase your progress and start again, you must:

\begin{itemize}
\item Go  to the Select Slot  screen, and press \textbf{Game  Select} or
  move  the joystick  left and  right until  you see  the slot  you want
  to erase.
\item Set both  of the Difficulty Switches on your  console to the ``A''
  (Advanced or Expert) position.
\item With your  joystick controller, pull back  and \emph{while holding
    the joystick back} press and hold the \textbf{Fire} button.
\item If you're \emph{sure} you want to erase your game's progress, then
  \emph{without}  letting  go  of  the \textbf{Fire}  button,  move  the
  joystick  forward. \ifdefined\DEMO  Your  game record  will be  erased
  \emph{immediately}. \fi
\end{itemize}

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{../Manual/EraseSlot\TV.png}
\end{center}

\ifdefined\DEMO

\emph{Once your game record has been  erased, you can not recover it, so
  think carefully before you erase it.}

\else

Make sure  you want to  erase your game.  Press the joystick  forward or
back to make your choice, and press the \textbf{Fire} button.

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{../Manual/ConfirmErase\TV.png}
\end{center}

\fi

\ifdefined\TVSECAM

The Left Difficulty Switch is also used to pause the game. After erasing
your progress, return the Left Difficulty Switch to the ``B'' position.

\fi

\subsection{Protecting Your Game Record}

If  either of  your Difficulty  Switches is  in the  ``B'' (Beginner  or
Novice) position, you can't erase a game slot.

\ifdefined\DEMO\else

\subsection{Recovering an Erased Game}

If you have just erased a game's  progress, and no one has started a new
game using the same slot yet, you may be able to un-erase it.

To recover  an erased game,  follow the same steps  as if you  wanted to
erase  a game.  Press  left and  right  on the  joystick  to select  the
now-empty  slot  (the  screen  will say  ``\texttt{BEGIN}'').  Set  both
Difficulty Switches  to the  ``A'' (Advanced  or Export)  position, pull
back  on  the joystick,  and  \emph{while  holding  it back},  hold  the
\textbf{Fire} button.

If your  game's progress can be  recovered, you'll see that  the slot is
\texttt{ERASED} and you should also see your name appear. To recover the
game's progress, press forward on the joystick. The game will immediately
become available to resume.

Note that it  is \emph{not possible} to recover a  saved game's progress
once  a new  game has  been  started in  the  same memory  slot. If  you
accidentally start  a new game,  but have  not confirmed your  name yet,
\emph{turn off the power briefly}, then try the recovery steps above.

\chapter{Grizzards and Moves}
\label{ch:Grizzards}

There are  30 Grizzards in  the game world,  each with their  own unique
starting attributes and sets of Moves.

\ifdefined\NOSAVE

In  this  demo,  you  can  play  with  only  one  Grizzard  at  a  time.
Other   Grizzards  are   available   with  a   memory   device  or   the
retail cartridge.

\fi

Each Grizzard is able  to learn up to 8 different  moves, in addition to
the move \texttt{RUN AWAY}. It's up  to you to discover which Moves each
Grizzard is able to learn.

\ifdefined\DEMO\else

\section{Dirtex}

\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{../Manual/Dirtex.png}

The green  Dirtex Grizzard (Num. 01)  lives in the desert.  It can learn
these Moves:

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{KICK DIRT} --- kick dirt at the enemy, causing some damage
  to them.
\item \texttt{BURY DEEP} --- try to bury the enemy, which may cause them
  to fall asleep.
\item  \texttt{DIRTY FOOT}  --- causes  some  damage and  may lower  the
  enemy's defend value.
\item \texttt{LOAMY FEAR} --- may lower the enemy's attack value.
\item \texttt{DUSTY EYES} --- may lower the enemy's defend value.
\end{itemize}

Dirtex may, if it gains enough experience, metamorphose into Lander.

\fi

\section{Aquax}

\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{../Manual/Aquax.png}

Aquax is  a brown Grizzard  (Num. 02) which lives  in the water.  It can
learn these Moves:

\begin{itemize}
\item  \texttt{SPLISH SPLASH}  --- splash  water at  the enemy,  causing
  some damage. 
\item \texttt{RAISE HOPE} --- may increase its own defend ability.
\item \texttt{SURE SPLASH} --- may increase its own attack ability.
\item \texttt{QUICK FOOT}  --- causes some damage and  may also decrease
  the enemy's defend ability.
\item \texttt{GREAT MOJO}  --- causes some damage and  may also decrease
  the enemy's attack ability.
\end{itemize}

With enough experience, Aquax can metamorphose into Sailor.

\ifdefined\DEMO\else

\section{Airex}

\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{../Manual/Airex.png}

Airex is  a teal  Grizzard (Num. 03)  which lives in  the trees.  It can
learn these Moves:

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{MILD SHOCK} --- shocks  the enemy with static electricity,
  causing some damage.
\item \texttt{WIND FIGHT} --- causes a bit more damage than \texttt{MILD SHOCK}
\item \texttt{STEAL ATTACK} --- may lower the enemy's attack value.
\item \texttt{STEAL DEFEND} --- may lower the enemy's defend value.
\item \texttt{STEAL TURN} --- may put the enemy to sleep
\end{itemize}

If Airex gains enough experience, it will metamorphose into Flyer.

\fi

\section{Healing}

Most Grizzards can learn healing moves as well. Some examples:

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{FIRST  AID} ---  heals a small  amount of  health, raising
  your own hit points.
\item \texttt{SIMPLE CURE} --- heals a bit larger amount of health.
\item \texttt{COMMON CURE} --- heals even more health.
\end{itemize}

You can also heal your Grizzard  by visiting a Grizzard Depot, or giving
them a healing  Potion. To use a potion, press  the \textbf{Fire} button
while on  the map  screen. You  can not  use a  potion during  a battle.
\ifdefined\DEMO There are no potions in this demo. \fi

\section{Run Away}

This Move lets you try to escape from a battle.

Your  Grizzard will  \emph{not}  be  healed if  you  run  away, but  the
monsters that you were facing will be healed immediately.

Certain  monsters  are too  terrifying  to  escape. When  you  encounter
a ``boss'' monster like that, it will  be a duel to the death. Watch out
for their unique shape on the map.

\section{Metamorphosis}

Many Grizzards  can metamorphose into a  new form when they  have gained
a certain amount  of experience by battling monsters.  Each Grizzard has
their  own experience;  they only  gain experience  when they  battle as
your companion.

When  a Grizzard  undergoes  metamorphosis, you'll  see an  announcement
screen  \ifdefined\DEMO  which  looks   as  though  you've  just  caught
a new Grizzard. In the full game, it's more obvious that this is because
of  a  metamorphosis. \else  which  shows  the Grizzard's  previous  and
new forms. \fi

These may  be signs that  a screen  (or the transition  between screens)
does not have the correct ``scan line'' count. This is a technical error
by the game's  developer (that's me!) and must be  corrected in the next
build of the game.

If you see these  effects (or if you are running in  an emulator, if you
notice that the  scan line count is not \ifdefined\TVNTSC  262 \else 312
