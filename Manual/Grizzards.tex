\chapter{Setting Up}\label{Setting Up}

To play \textit{Grizzards}, you will need:

\begin{itemize}
\item An Atari  console: the Atari Video Computer  System CX-2600, Sears
  Tele-Games  Video Arcade,  Atari  2600jr game  system,  or Atari  7800
  ProSystem
\item A TV or video display
\item        A        joystick         controller        (or        SEGA
  \ifdefined\TVNTSC{Genesis/}\fi{}MegaDrive gamepad)
  \ifdefined\NOSAVE\else
\item A  memory device: an  AtariVox device with (optional)  speakers or
  headphones, or a MemCard or SaveKey device.
  \fi
\item The \textit{Grizzards} game cartridge
\end{itemize}

\section{Console Controls}

\ifdefined\TVSECAM
\else

\ifdefined\TVPAL
\subsection{Colour/B\&W Switch (Pause)}

On an  Atari 2600  (or Sears Arcade)  you can pause  the game  using the
\textbf{Colour/B\&W Switch}.  Push the \textbf{Colour/B\&W}  switch into
the \textbf{Colour} position  to play, or the  \textbf{B\&W} position to
pause the game.

\else

\subsection{Color/B\&W Switch (Pause)}

On an  Atari 2600  (or Sears Arcade)  you can pause  the game  using the
\textbf{Color/B\&W Switch}. Push the \textbf{Color/B\&W} switch into the
\textbf{Color} position to play, or the \textbf{B\&W} position to pause the game.

On the  Atari 7800, press  the \textbf{Pause}  button once to  pause the
game, and again to resume playing.

\fi
\fi

\subsection{Game Select}

When  viewing the  Title Screen,  you can  use the  \textbf{Game Select}
switch to \ifdefined\NOSAVE
begin your game or start over
\else
choose the Slot you wish to use to save your progress.
\fi

While you  are playing the  game, you  can use the  \textbf{Game Select}
switch to review your Grizzard's  statistics from the Map screen, Combat
screen, or a Grizzard Depot.

\subsection{Game Reset}

When  viewing the  Select  Slot screen,  press  the \textbf{Game  Reset}
switch to begin playing the game.

While you are playing the game,  press the \textbf{Game Reset} switch to
abandon your progress and return to  the Title Screen. You will lose any
progress since the last time you visited a Grizzard Depot.

\subsection{Difficulty Switches}

You cannot delete a game in progress unless both Difficulty Switches are
in the  ``A'' (Advanced or Expert)  position. To protect your  game from
being deleted,  set either one of  the Difficulty Switches to  the ``B''
(Beginner or Novice) position.

\ifdefined\TVSECAM

The Left Difficulty Switch  can be used to pause game  play. When in the
``A'' (Advanced  or Expert) position, you  will not be able  to continue
playing  until  you  toggle  the   switch  to  the  ``B''  (Beginner  or
Novice) position.

\else

This  game does  not  make  use of  the  Difficulty  Switches while  you
are playing. 

\fi

\section{Using a Gamepad}

A   SEGA  \ifdefined\TVNTSC{Genesis/}\fi{}MegaDrive   gamepad  (or   other
compatible controller) may also be used with \textit{Grizzards}. Use the
\textbf{B} button  as the \textbf{Fire} button.  Use the \textbf{C} button  as an
alternative way to press the \textbf{Game Select} switch.

Your gamepad must be plugged in before you turn on the power if you want
to use it. Otherwise, the \textbf{C} button will be ignored.

\section{Start a Game}

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{../Manual/TitleAquax\TV.png}
\end{center}

Once your  console is set  up and everything  is connected, turn  on the
Power  switch. You'll  see  the  title screen  appear.  If  you have  an
AtariVox device, you'll also hear the title spoken.


\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{../Manual/SelectSlot\TV.png}
\end{center}

Press the \textbf{Game Select} switch or \textbf{Fire} button to move to
the
\ifdefined\NOSAVE
Start Game screen.

Press the  joystick left or  right to choose whether  to \texttt{RESUME}
your current game  in progress or \texttt{BEGIN} a new  game, then press
\textbf{Game Reset} or the \textbf{Fire} button.

\else
Select Slot screen.

Press  the \textbf{Game  Select} switch  or move  the joystick  left and
right to choose  a memory slot\footnote{Technical Note:  The Slot number
  chosen  here is  relative to  the three  save game  slots used  by the
  \textit{Grizzards} game program. Each save game slot actually occupies
  4 blocks  on your memory  device.} for your  game. There are  3 memory
slots  possible. Press  \textbf{Game Select}  or the  joystick again  to
rotate   through  them.   If   someone  has   already   begun  to   play
\textit{Grizzards}   in  a   certain   slot,  your   screen  will   show
``\texttt{RESUME}.''    If    a    slot    is    empty,    you'll    see
``\texttt{BEGIN}'' instead.

\ifdefined\DEMO
\skip
This  demo  saves your  progress  in  the  ``scratchpad'' area  of  your
memory  device.  It's possible  that  other  games might  overwrite  and
destroy your saved progress. This is  just because it's a demo, and does
not have a private area reserved for it yet.
\skip
\fi

When you have selected the slot you want to begin (or resume), press the
\textbf{Game Reset} switch or \textbf{Fire} button to start.

\fi

You'll begin in the ruins of  Treble Village after the monsters invaded.
You know that to the east are  the extremely dangerous \textbf{Fire} Bog, so your
best  bet   is  to  head   west  (left)  and   see  if  there   are  any
other survivors.

\section{Roaming The World}

The   World   Map   screen   shows   your   current   score   (initially
\texttt{000000}) at  the top of the  screen. In the map  display, you'll
see the  current area in which  you are traveling. Guide  yourself using
the joystick controller.

To   review  your   Grizzard's   statistics,   press  the   \textbf{Game
  Select} switch.

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{../Manual/Map\TV.png}
\end{center}

As  you   travel,  you  may   encounter  monsters,\ifdefined\NOSAVE\else
Grizzards,  \fi  Grizzard Depots,  other  people,  signposts, or  doors.
To interact with them, simply walk into them.

A  monster,  or group  of  monsters,  look  like this:

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=1in]{../Manual/Monster\TV.png}
\end{center}

Sometimes these  monsters may sneak  up on  you and attack!  Other times
you'll see  them waiting for you  and can avoid  them --- or walk  up to
them when you're ready to face them.

A Grizzard Depot looks like this:

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=1in]{../Manual/Depot\TV.png}
\end{center}

\ifdefined\NOSAVE

In  this no-save  demo, you  will  have one  Grizzard companion,  Aquax.
With a  memory device, you  may encounter  other Grizzards that  you can
convince to join your party.

\else

You may also  encounter Grizzards in the world that  you can convince to
join your party. A wild Grizzard looks like this:

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=1in]{../Manual/WildGrizzard\TV.png}
  *** WRITEME missing art
\end{center}

At a  Grizzard Depot, you'll have  the option to swap  Grizzards in your
party,  with up  to  30 total  Grizzards saved  in  your memory  device.
Each Grizzard may have its own moves and skill scores.

\fi

A door looks like this:

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=1in]{../Manual/Door\TV.png}
\end{center}

A signpost looks like this:

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=1in]{../Manual/Signpost\TV.png}
\end{center}

A person looks like this:

\begin{center}
  \includegraphics[width=1in]{../Manual/Person\TV.png}
\end{center}

\section{Grizzard Depots}

To \ifdefined\NOSAVE\else  swap which  Grizzard you're using,  or to  \fi heal
your current Grizzard partner, you'll need to find a Grizzard Depot.

\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{../Manual/DepotScreenshot\TV.png}

Touch the Grizzard Depot on the map screen to enter it.

\begin{figure*}[b]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=2\columnwidth]{../Manual/GrizzardDepot.png}
  \end{center}
\end{figure*}

\ifdefined\NOSAVE\else
Your progress will \emph{immediately} be saved to your memory device.
\fi

At  a  Grizzard  Depot  your  Grizzard partner  will  be  fully  healed.
\ifdefined\NOSAVE\else You can then use the joystick to choose a different
Grizzard to travel with you. \fi

Here,  you'll  see  the   word  \texttt{DEPOT},  your  current  Grizzard
companion, and the number of hours you've been playing Grizzards (total,
since you first started in this slot).

To   review  your   Grizzard's   statistics,   press  the   \textbf{Game
  Select} switch or move the joystick left or right.

\ifdefined\NOSAVE\else
If you  have more than one  Grizzard in your collection,  you can choose
which  Grizzard will  be  your  companion. Press  up  (forward) or  down
(backward)  on  the  joystick  controller  to  cycle  through  available
Grizzards.
\fi

When you're ready to return to your adventure, press the \textbf{Fire} button.


\section{Battling Monsters}

Monsters plague the world of Syrex. If you're caught by monsters without
a Grizzard partner, they're sure to eat you alive! Luckily your Grizzard
partner  will  defend  you  from  them,  and  monsters  will  attack  it
before you.

\begin{figure*}[ht]
  \includegraphics[width=2\columnwidth]{../Manual/CombatControls.png}
\end{figure*}

When you encounter monsters, you'll  see the Combat display.

\begin{figure}[b]
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{../Manual/CombatScreen\TV.png}
  \caption{The Combat screen}
\end{figure}

Monsters may  travel in  groups, so  you may see  more than  one monster
facing you.

The  long bar  beneath your  Grizzard represents  its health.  If it  is
reduced to zero, your adventure will be over.

Using the joystick controller, you can  choose from among the moves that
your Grizzard knows how to perform. Press  up and down to select a move.
If your Grizzard knows  how to perform a move, it  will appear in color.
If your Grizzard does not yet know how to perform a move, it will appear
in black.

Most  Moves will  target one  monster  that you're  facing. (Some  Moves
instead affect yourself.) Press left or right on the joystick controller
to select a target if you're facing multiple monsters.

When you  see the selection  you want, press  the \textbf{Fire} button.  You must
select a move that your Grizzard knows how to perform.

To review the statistics of your Grizzard, press \textbf{Game Select}.

\begin{figure}[t]
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{../Manual/StatsScreenshot\TV.png}
  \caption{Viewing your Grizzard's statistics}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Executing a Move}

It's possible for a move to miss its target. If that happens, you'll see
\texttt{MISSED} appear briefly.

After a move  has been executed, the creature targeted  by that move may
be injured (lose hit points) or  have its statistics changed. Changes to
statistics  are temporary  and last  only  the duration  of one  battle.
After the battle,  your Grizzard's statistics (or those  of any monsters
you failed to defeat) will return to normal.

If  you Grizzard  loses hit  points, the  bar below  your Grizzard  will
reduce in  length. When your Grizzard  is nearly out of  hit points, the
bar will change to a red color to draw attention to that fact.

If your  Grizzard is defeated, the  monsters will surely eat  you alive.
Your adventure will end there, and you'll return to the title screen.
\ifdefined\NOSAVE
You can  resume your  game from  the Start Game  screen, or  start over.
\else
Don't worry, though;  you can continue from the last  Grizzard Depot you
visited by  resuming your  game's saved progress.  Just choose  the same
game slot and resume and try again.
\fi

If you  defeat all of  the monsters, victory  is yours! Your  score will
increase, and you'll return to the World Map screen victorious.

You  may choose  to run  away from  a fight,  but the  monsters will  be
immediately healed and may still come after you.

\subsection{Grizzard Learning}

Your  Grizzard companion  may  learn from  opposing  Monsters. This  can
result  in your  Grizzard  increasing  its Attack  or  Defend score,  or
learning a Move that a monster has just performed.

Your Grizzard  can only  learn certain moves.  Moves that  your Grizzard
might be able to  perform, but does not yet know how  to, will appear in
black on the Combat display.

\subsection{Statistics}

You can  also press  the \textbf{Game Select}  switch while  viewing the
Map, Combat, or a Grizzard Depot to review your Grizzard's statistics.

Once  you've reviewed  them,  press the  \textbf{Fire} button  to  return to  the
previous screen.

Each Grizzard companion has a few statistics:

\begin{description}
  
\item[\texttt{ATK}] is the Grizzard's  \emph{attack} rating. This is the
  likelihood  that your  Grizzard will  hit when  it attacks  a monster.
  Some Moves cause more damage than others, though.
  
\item[\texttt{DEF}] is the Grizzard's  \emph{defend} rating. This is how
  likely your Grizzard is to avoid being hurt by a monster's Move.

\item[\texttt{HP}]  is  the  Grizzard's  \emph{hit  points}  or  health.
  When  monsters hit  your Grizzard,  this  value will  decrease. If  it
  reaches zero, your game is over.

\item[\texttt{MAX}]  is   the  Grizzard's  \emph{maximum   hit  points}.
  Your Grizzard can gain more hit points up to this amount.
  
\end{itemize}

Each of  these statistics can  be raised up to  a maximum of  99 points.
They may go up a bit after each monster that you defeat.

Your  Grizzard may  also  be  subject to  one  or  more Status  Effects.
These  will  alter your  Grizzard's  status  temporarily (only  for  the
duration of one battle).

\begin{figure*}[b]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=2\columnwidth]{../Manual/GrizzardDepot.png}
    *** WRITEME wrong art piece
  \end{center}
\end{figure*}


\subsection{Status Effects}

A move can affect its target with Status Effects. There are six possible
Status Effects that can influence a creature:

\begin{description}
\item[\texttt{SLEEP}] A creature which has gone to sleep can not move on
  their turn. There is a 50\% chance of waking on each turn.
\item[\texttt{ATK UP}] A  creature with Attack Up has  its normal attack
  score doubled.
\item[\texttt{ATK DN}] A creature with Attack Down has its normal attack
  score halved.
\item[\texttt{DEF UP}] A  creature with Defend Up has  its normal defend
  score doubled.
\item[\texttt{DEF DN}] A creature with Defend Down has its normal defend
  score halved.
\item[\texttt{MUDDLE}] A creature which has been Muddled will choose its
  moves at random. There is a 50\% chance of clearing its mind on each turn.
\end{description}

\subsection{Scoring}

When you  defeat a monster, you'll  earn points. The number  of points
you earn will increase as you defeat more difficult monsters.

Your score begins at \texttt{000000} when you start your adventure.

\section{Game Over}

If  you fail  in your  mission,  your game  is over.  However, you  have
another chance to continue.

\begin{figure}[b]
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{../Manual/GameOver\TV.png}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

When you continue, it'll  be just as if you'd never  failed in the first
place. However,  you'll start over from  \ifdefined\NOSAVE the beginning
of the game, \else the last Grizzard Depot that you had visited, \fi but
with your  current progress.  \ifdefined\NOSAVE\else If you  fail before
visiting a Grizzard Depot, you'll return to the original starting point.
\fi

Just  choose   your  game   slot  from  the   Title  Screen   to  resume
your adventure.

\section{Winning the Campaign}\label{Winning the Campaign}

\ifdefined\DEMO

You can't win the full campaign  in this demo version. However, there is
one quest  that you can  complete. When  you have completed  that quest,
a person in  the game will let  you know that you've reached  the end of
the demo. At that  point, you can continue to level  up your Grizzard by
fighting more monsters,  but you won't be able to  make more progress in
the story.

\else

If  you  defeat  all of  the  main  monsters  in  the game,  you'll  see
a fireworks  show to let  you know  that you've completed  the campaign.
Your ``final'' score will appear above the fireworks display.

\fi

\section{Starting Over}\label{Starting Your Adventure Over}

\ifdefined\NOSAVE

When  you  start  the  game,  you can  \texttt{BEGIN}  a  new  game,  or
\texttt{RESUME} your existing game.

\else

When you choose a  slot with no game record in  it already, you'll begin
a new adventure.

If you want to delete your adventure  and start again, it's a little bit
tricky. This is to make sure you don't accidentally lose your progress!

From the  Title Screen, press  \textbf{Game Select} or the  \textbf{Fire} button.
Then, press  \textbf{Game Select}  or move the  joystick left  and right
until the slot you want to erase is shown.

Here's the tricky part. You'll need to:

\begin{itemize}
\item Make sure that both of the Difficulty Switches on your console
  are set to the ``A'' (Advanced or Expert) position.
\item With your joystick controller, pull down (toward you) on the
  joystick and hold down the \textbf{Fire} button.
\end{itemize}

The screen  will change from  saying ``\texttt{SELECT SLOT}''  to saying
``\texttt{ERASE  SLOT}.''   The  text   will  also   be  red   to  catch
your attention.

If  you're  \emph{sure}   you  want  to  erase  your   game  data,  then
\emph{without}  letting go  of the  \textbf{Fire}  button, move  the joystick  up
(toward  the TV).  You'll see  that the  slot changes  from ``\texttt{IN
  USE}'' to ``\texttt{VACANT}'' \emph{immediately}.

\emph{Once your game record has been erased, you can not recover it from
  the game, so think carefully before you erase it.}

\subsection{Protecting Your Game Record}

If  either of  your Difficulty  Switches is  in the  ``B'' (Beginner  or
Novice) position, then you can't erase  a game slot. \emph{Tip: When you
  connect your memory device, check the position of those switches.}

\ifdefined\TVSECAM

Remember,  the  Left  Difficulty  Switch  is used  to  pause  the  game.
After deleting your save game slot, return the Left Difficulty Switch to
the ``B'' position.

\chapter{Grizzards and Moves}

There are  30 Grizzards in  the game world,  each with their  own unique
starting attributes and sets of Moves.

\ifdefined\NOSAVE

In  this  demo, you  can  play  with  only  Aquax. Other  Grizzards  are
available with a memory device.

\fi

Each Grizzard is able  to learn up to 8 different  moves, in addition to
the universal move  \texttt{RUN AWAY}. It's up to you  to discover which
Moves each  Grizzard is  able to  learn.

\ifdefined\DEMO\else

Depending on which edition of  \textit{Grizzards} you have, you'll start
with  one  of  three  different Grizzard  companions.  Your  ``starter''
Grizzard will be featured on the title screen of the game.

\section{Dirtex}

\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{../Manual/Dirtex.png}

The green Dirtex Grizzard lives in the grass. It can learn these Moves:

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{KICK DIRT} --- kick dirt at the enemy, causing some damage
  to them.
\item \texttt{BURY DEEP} --- try to bury the enemy, which may cause them
  to fall asleep.
\item  \texttt{DIRTY FOOT}  --- causes  some  damage and  may lower  the
  enemy's defend value.
\item \texttt{LOAMY FEAR} --- may lower the enemy's attack value.
\item \texttt{DUSTY EYES} --- may lower the enemy's defend value.
\item \texttt{FIRST  AID} ---  heals a small  amount of  health, raising
  your own hit points.
\item \texttt{SIMPLE CURE} --- heals a bit larger amount of health.
\item \texttt{COMMON CURE} --- heals even more health.
\end{itemize}

\fi

\section{Aquax}

\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{../Manual/Aquax.png}

Aquax is a brown Grizzard which lives  in the swamps. It can learn these
Moves:

\begin{itemize}
\item  \texttt{SPLISH SPLASH}  --- splash  water at  the enemy,  causing
  some damage. 
\item \texttt{RAISE HOPE} --- may increase its own defend ability.
\item \texttt{SURE SPLASH} --- may increase its own attack ability.
\item \texttt{QUICK FOOT}  --- causes some damage and  may also decrease
  the enemy's defend ability.
\item \texttt{GREAT MOJO}  --- causes some damage and  may also decrease
  the enemy's attack ability.
\item \texttt{FIRST  AID} ---  heals a small  amount of  health, raising
  your own hit points.
\item \texttt{SIMPLE CURE} --- heals a bit larger amount of health.
\item \texttt{COMMON CURE} --- heals even more health.
\end{itemize}

\ifdefined\DEMO\else

\section{Airex}

\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{../Manual/Airex.png}

Airex is a teal Grizzard which lives in the trees. It can learn these Moves:

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{MILD SHOCK} --- shocks  the enemy with static electricity,
  causing some damage.
\item \texttt{WIND FIGHT} --- causes a bit more damage than \texttt{MILD SHOCK}
\item \texttt{STEAL ATTACK} --- may lower the enemy's attack value.
\item \texttt{STEAL DEFEND} --- may lower the enemy's defend value.
\item \texttt{STEAL TURN} --- may put the enemy to sleep
\item \texttt{FIRST  AID} ---  heals a small  amount of  health, raising
  your own hit points.
\item \texttt{SIMPLE CURE} --- heals a bit larger amount of health.
\item \texttt{COMMON CURE} --- heals even more health.
\end{itemize}

\section{Run Away}

This Move lets you try to escape from a battle.

Your Grizzard  will \emph{not}  be healed  if you  run away  (unless you
visit a Grizzard Depot); however, the monsters that you were facing will
be healed immediately.

Certain monsters are too terrifying to escape from.


\chapter{Monsters}

Terrible monsters are  arriving in Syrex, terrorizing the  people. A few
of them are described here.

\vspace{14pt}

\lettrine[image=true,       lines=5, findent=3pt, nindent=3pt]{../Manual/Wicked-Slime.png}{Wicked}
Slimes are weak slime monsters that your Grizzard can kill fairly easily
… but beware when they travel  in large packs. Like many creatures, they
know some healing Moves that might be useful to learn. Wicked Slimes are
now found near Treble Village and the Lost Mine.

\vspace{14pt}

\lettrine[image=true,       lines=5, findent=3pt, nindent=3pt]{../Manual/Horrid-Slime.png}{Horrid}
Slimes  are more  dangerous  than a  Wicked Slime.  A  Horrid Slime  may
survive your attacks until you've learned some new moves.

\vspace{14pt}

\lettrine[image=true,       lines=5, findent=3pt, nindent=3pt]{../Manual/Vorpal-Bunny.png}{Vorpal}
Bunnies are a  powerful monster that will  take a few hits  to kill, but
they're the only way for Aquax  to learn Great Mojo. Beware their attack
Moves, though! You may find Vorpal Bunnies near the Spiral Woods.

\vspace{14pt}

\lettrine[image=true,    lines=5, findent=3pt, nindent=3pt]{../Manual/R.O.U.S..png}{Rodents}    of
Unusual Size are one  of the dangers of the Fire Bog  (but I don't think
they   really   exist).   They're    known   to   attack   pirates   and
princesses alike.

\vspace{14pt}

\lettrine[image=true,  lines=5, findent=3pt, nindent=3pt]{../Manual/Flame-Doggo.png}{Flame Doggos}
are a  danger of the  Fire Bogs. These beasts  often roam in  packs, and
their fur is on fire. Avoid the  Fire Bogs until you have begun to train
your Grizzard to have a higher Attack stat.

\vspace{14pt}

\lettrine[image=true, lines=5, findent=3pt, nindent=3pt]{../Manual/Will-O-Wisp.png}{Will-O-Wisps}
are bright,  floating sparks that are  known to travel in  large groups.
Once your Attack score is high enough to hit them, they go down quickly,
but they have very strong defenses!

\vspace{14pt}

\lettrine[image=true, lines=5, findent=3pt, nindent=3pt]{../Manual/Lectro-Sheep.png}{Lectro Sheep}
are dangerous sheep  that are full of static electricity.  They roam the
countryside, as sheep will do.

\pagebreak

\lettrine[image=true,       lines=5, findent=3pt, nindent=3pt]{../Manual/Viking-Turtle.png}{Viking
  Turtles} are dangerous waterfront creatures that can be very dangerous
to encounter.

\vspace{14pt}

\lettrine[image=true, lines=5, findent=3pt, nindent=3pt]{../Manual/Crazy-Fox.png}{Crazy Foxes} are
likely to unleash a  great deal of pain. It's said  that they were never
actually foxes to begin with, but are created already crazy.

\vspace{14pt}

\lettrine[image=true, lines=5, findent=3pt, nindent=3pt]{../Manual/Water-Kitty.png}{Water Kitties}
are a special kind of cat that  likes to swim, and to dish out punishing
water-based attacks on anyone who comes near them.

\vspace{14pt}

\lettrine[image=true,  lines=5, findent=3pt, nindent=3pt]{../Manual/Fuzzie-Bear.png}{Fuzzie Bears}
sound like  a cute and cuddly  creature, but they're really  a lumbering
tower of teeth and claws looking for someone to eat.

\vspace{14pt}

\lettrine[image=true,   lines=5, findent=3pt, nindent=3pt]{../Manual/Metal-Mouse.png}{Metal  Mice}
are extremely durable, so it can take  a while to chip away at their hit
points, but the rewards in points earned may well be worth it.

\vspace{14pt}

\lettrine[image=true,   lines=5, findent=3pt, nindent=3pt]{../Manual/Fire-Panda.png}{Fire  Pandas}
are a bit  like Red Pandas, a  bit like Firefoxes, and quite  a bit more
dangerous. Unlike a  firefox, these beasts actually  dish out fire-based
attacks on their victims.

\section*{and many more...}

There  are many  other monsters  roaming the  countryside across  Syrex.
You'll have to discover the others on your own. Here's a hint: There are
more than 40 types of monsters that you can face.

\chapter{Troubleshooting}

\ifdefined\DEMO

\section{Screen ``Jitters,'' freezes,  \ifdefined\TVPAL appears in black
  \& white,\fi or flashes blue}

These may  be signs that  a screen  (or the transition  between screens)
does not have the correct ``scan line'' count. This is a technical error
by the game's  developer (that's me!) and must be  surecorrected in the next
version of the game.

\ifdefined\TVPAL
If the  picture is in  black-and-white throughout, make sure  you're not
running the SECAM version.
\fi

If you see these effects (or if you are running in Stella, if you notice
that the scan  line count is not \ifdefined\TVNTSC 262  \else 312 \fi at
all         times)         please         report         them         to
\hred{mailto:support@star-hope.org}{support@star-hope.org} so  that they
can be corrected before the game is finished.

\fi

\section{Sad Face Screen}

If you  see the Sad  Face screen,  the game is  trying to tell  you that
there is a problem.

From here, you can press the \textbf{Game Reset} switch to return to the
Title Screen.

\ifdefined\NOSAVE\else

\subsection{Red Sad Face Screen: Memory Device Needed}

\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{../Manual/RedSadFace\TV.png}

The red  sad face screen  means that your  memory device was  not found.
Turn off  your console and connect  an AtariVox, SaveKey, or  MemCard to
the right  controller port. You  may plug  in speakers or  headphones to
your AtariVox so that you can hear the game voices.

\fi

\subsection{White Sad Face Screen}

\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{../Manual/WhiteSadFace\TV.png}

The white sad  face screen means that the game  has encountered an error
and cannot continue. 

You  should   not  be  able   to  reach  this  screen.   Please  contact
\href{mailto:support@star-hope.org}{support@star-hope.org}           for
additional assistance. Send the code  number that appears on this screen
with your email.

\section{Pause button must be held down (7800)}

This  is believed  to  be  a side  effect  of  certain multi-carts,  eg.
PlusCart.   If  you   are  encountering   this  problem,   please  check
\href{https://github.com/brpocock/grizzards/issues/182}{https://\-github.com/\-brpocock/\-grizzards/\-issues/\-182}
for current information.

Note that  you can  press \textbf{Game Select}  to view  your Grizzard's
stats and effectively pause the game as well.

\ifdefined\NOSAVE\else

\section{TV goes blank when entering Grizzard Depot}

Make  sure your  memory device  is  securely connected.  If your  memory
device is not connected when the game  tries to save, you may see the TV
picture remain blank while the game tries to record your progress.

\section{No voices}

When the game first starts the title screen, on the title screen, you'll
hear the AtariVox announce the name of the game. If you don't, make sure
that  the AtariVox  is connected  and the  speakers (or  headphones) are
connected, powered on, and turned up.

Naturally,  there  are  no  voices   when  playing  with  a  MemCard  or
SaveKey device.

\fi

\chapter{Technical Notes}

The following notes are of interest to hackers only. You don't need to
understand anything in this section to play \textit{Grizzards}.

\section{Development Tools}

The \textit{Grizzards} source code and development tools are available from
\href{https://Star-Hope.org/games/Grizzards/}{https://Star-Hope\-.org/\-games/\-Grizzards/} 
the \textit{Grizzards} web site.

\ifdefined\NOSAVE

\section{No-Save Version}

This special  No-Save demo does not  allow you to save  your progress or
catch Grizzards,  but it can  be used without  a memory device  (such as
SaveKey, MemCard, or AtariVox). When you turn off power to your console,
all progress is erased.

\else

\section{Game Record Slots}

There are 3  logical game slots that  you can choose from  for the game.
Each save game  slot takes up 4  blocks (256 bytes) of  storage space on
your memory  device, for a  total of 12 blocks  for all three  save game
slots. The following blocks are used:

\ifdefined\DEMO

\begin{enumerate}
\item blocks \$c0-\$c3 (addresses \$3000-\$30ff)
\item blocks \$c4-\$c7 (addresses \$3100-\$31ff)
\item blocks \$c8-\$cb (addresses \$3200-\$32ff)
\end{enumerate}

These blocks are in the Scratchpad  area. This means that other programs
might potentially disrupt or destroy your saved game record.

The final version of this game will use a different set of memory blocks
that  are  reserved   for  its  own  private  use,  so   this  won't  be
a problem then.

\else

\begin{enumerate}
\item blocks \$44-\$47 (addresses \$1100-\$11ff)
\item blocks \$48-\$4b (addresses \$1200-\$12ff)
\item blocks \$4c-\$4f (addresses \$1300-\$13ff)
\end{enumerate}

The addresses used by the Save  Game Slots are registered with AtariAge,
so they won't conflict with any other games you might play.

A deleted game can  sometimes be recovered if you have  a Harmony or Uno
cartridge, or  a similar cartridge to  which you can upload  a ROM file.
Visit the Grizzards web site at
\href{https://Star-Hope.org/games/Grizzards/}{https://Star-Hope\-.org/\-games/\-Grizzards/}
and download the  Unerase utility program. If you have  just erased your
game's progress, you can probably recover it.

You will also be able to find the Unerase utility in the PlusCart library.

\fi


\subsection{Portability}

The save game records are in the same format for all \textit{Grizzards} game
cartridges, regardless of the region for which they were saved.  This means
that you can save your progress on an NTSC type system and then continue
playing on a PAL or SECAM system, or vice-versa.

\ifdefined\DEMO

The save  game slots used by  this demo, however, are  distinct from the
ones that will be used in the final game.
