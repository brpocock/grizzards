\chapter{Grizzards}

There  are 30  different  Grizzards  that you  can  catch  and train  in
the  game.  Each   Grizzard  has  its  own  statistics   and  can  learn
different Moves. 

\begin{grizzardpage}{Dirtex}{01}{10}{1}{1}{Lander}

  Dirtex  is one  of the  Starter  Grizzards that  you can  choose at  the
  beginning of the game. A green anole-like Grizzard, it is native to dry,
  desert regions. Dirtex's Moves tend to be more aggressive than the other
  two Starters.

\end{grizzardpage}

\begin{grizzardpage}{Aquax}{02}{10}{1}{1}{Sailor}

  Aquax  is one  of  the Starter  Grizzards  that you  can  choose at  the
  beginning of the game. A brown  alligator-like Grizzard, it is native to
  swamps.  Of the  three Starters,  Aquax  is the  most balanced  Grizzard
  between attacking and defending Moves.

\end{grizzardpage}

\begin{grizzardpage}{Airex}{03}{10}{1}{1}{Flyer}

Airex  is one  of  the Starter  Grizazrds  that you  can  choose at  the
beginning  of  the  game.  A  teal  gecko-like  Grizzard,  it  lives  in
the treetops. Airex's Moves are  more focused on buffing, debuffing, and
healing Moves than the other two Starters.
  
\end{grizzardpage}

\begin{grizzardpage}{Flamex}{04}{20}{6}{4}{Burner}

Flamex can be found in the Fire Bog.
  
\end{grizzardpage}

\begin{grizzardpage}{Petty}{05}{30}{1}{1}{Tyrant}

  Petty is found near  the foot of the cliffs on the  south side of Port
  Lion, to the west of the paths that lead up the cliffs.

  While  Petty  is  a  surprisingly  weak Grizzard  at  first,  it  does
  metamorphose into  one of the stronger  Grizzards — Tyrant —  and from
  there,  eventually  can become  the  very  strongest Grizzard  of  all
  — Megax. Training Petty is a  difficult exercise, but it pays off well
  in the end.

\end{grizzardpage}

\begin{grizzardpage}{Wetnas}{06}{15}{6}{4}{}

Wetnas is  found on the narrow  road leading from Treble  Village to the
south, just  north of the Lost  Mine's entrance. For most  players, this
will   be   the  first   Grizzard   that   you'll  catch,   after   your
Starter Grizzard.

While Wetnas's  stats are an improvement  over the Starters, and  it has
better Moves,  there are  advantages to returning  to Treble  Village to
switch  back to  your Starter  Grizzard —  in particular,  they tend  to
metamorphose  into  better Grizzards  than  Wetnas  if you  continue  to
train them.

\chapter{Monsters}\label{ch:Monsters}

The world of Syrex has been  invaded by hordes of monsters. Each monster
has its own Moves and statistics.

The statistics  for a monster  are raised when  you play in  Expert mode
(with the  Left Difficulty Switch  in the  ``A'' position), or  when you
encounter the  monster in New Game  Plus mode. In the  tables below, the
Enhanced value is  used in \emph{either} Expert mode  \emph{or} New Game
Plus. The  Severe value  is used  when playing  New Game  Plus \emph{in}
Expert Mode.



In addition,  nearly all monsters can  grow to Boss forms.  (Some unique
monsters \emph{only} occur in Boss forms, however.) Boss forms also have
enhanced statistics.

\chapter{Places}\label{ch:Places}

The world of Syrex can be considered to have three main areas:

\begin{itemize}
\item the Mainland,
\item the island of Port Lion,
\item and the Underworld.
\end{itemize}

Each area has its own distinct musical theme.

You  might also  notice that  when you're  above-ground, the  map screen
shows a  lighter colored ground  (compared to  the walls), but  when you
travel underground, the walls are lighter than the ground.

\section{The Mainland}

This is where you begin the game, and takes up the eastern side of the map.

\subsection{Treble Village}

    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{center}
  \addcontentsline{map}{map}{Map of Treble Village}
  \caption{Map of Treble Village}
\end{figure*}

Treble village has been destroyed almost completely by monsters, but a few brave
souls have hunkered  down. From the Grizzard  Depot in the east to  the docks in
the west, there isn't a single house left standing.

You'll   begin  the   game   in  the   ruins  of   Treble   village  with   your
Starting Grizzard.  You can only get  the two other Starter  Grizzards (the ones
you did not choose at first) by winning the game and beginning a New Game Plus.

\subsection{Fire Bog}

\begin{figure*}[ht]
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
      \draw [<->] (2, 1.5) -- (0, 1.5);
      \node [above] at (1, 1.5) { Treble };

    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{center}
  \addcontentsline{map}{map}{Map of the Fire Bog}
  \caption{Map of the Fire Bog}
\end{figure*}

The dangerous Fire Bog is full of monsters. Watch your step, or Flame Doggos and
Rodents of Unusual Size may attack you.

Near  the west  side of  the Fire  Bog,  a Boss  Rodent of  Unusual Size  blocks
a  particularly winding  path. In  the east,  one of  the survivors  from Treble
Village has an artifact that you'll need to open the tunnels under Mount Peshon,
and you can also catch Flamex.

The road running along the north side of Mount Peshon reaches from the Lost Mine
in the west to the Spiral Woods in  the east. Near the Spiral Woods, a crossroad
joins up to the Fire Bog and the entrance to the Mount Peshon tunnels.

A lonely radio repair shop can be found near the Lost Mine entrance.

  \caption{Map of the Mount Peshon tunnels}
\end{figure*}

Mount Peshon  divides the mainland into  a northern and southern  side. The only
way through are a series of tunnels beneath the mountain.

When the  game begins, the  tunnels cannot be  opened because the  two artifacts
used to open them, which were in Treble village, are missing.

If  you do  manage to  get into  the  tunnels, your  passage may  be blocked  by
emergency barricades  that are  put up whenever  a Grue is  heard in  the caves.
Nobody knows quite what a Grue looks  like, because they usually eat anyone that
comes across them, and they live in the dark places beneath Syrex.

It's  also been  known that  there are  side  caves off  the main  one in  which
a terrible Cyclops is raising a herd of venomous sheep.

  \caption{Map of the Spiral Woods}
\end{figure*}

The Spiral Woods are full of  Crazy Foxes, Vorpal Bunnies, and Will-O-Wisps, but
somewhere in the center of the forest is a Grizzard Depot.

One of  the survivors of Treble  Village can be  found in the Woods,  holding an
important artifact.

A Grizzard Trainer in Anchor village will  tell you that she's lost a pendant in
the Spiral Woods. If you find an  area with relatively few monsters, it might be
wise to search for that pendant --- there's sure to be a great reward.

Windoo can be found in the Spiral Woods.

\subsection{Southern Fields}

\begin{figure*}[ht]

    \begin{tikzpicture}
      \draw (0, 0) rectangle (2, 1);

  \end{center}
  \addcontentsline{map}{map}{Map of the Southern Field and Anchor Village}
  \caption{Map of the Southern Field and Anchor Village}
\end{figure*}

The Southern Fields are beset with monsters, too, now, but they haven't yet come
up into Anchor Village.

The  only  way  in  or  out  of   the  Southern  Fields  is  through  the  Mount
Peshon tunnel, but there is a hidden cave into Mount Peshon as well. If you find
the key to revealing the cave's entrance, you'll also discover a hidden Grizzard
Depot nearby.

\subsection{Anchor Village}

Still mostly  unharmed by the  monsters, Anchor  Village is built  around Anchor
Rock, a large red monolith from the ancient past.

Villagers here can be very helpful,  manufacturing potions, using their radio to
call ships  to the Treble  village docks, or even  giving you access  to trained
Grizzards that they no longer need: Cornet, Ambren, and Noctis.

\section{Lost Mine}

Delving deep into the underworld, the Lost Mine is a maze in which it is far too
easy to lose yourself. Even going back the  way in which you came might take you
someplace different, if you're not careful.

Somewhere in the mine can be found Splodo, near an abandoned Grizzard Depot.

Mapping  the Lost  Mine does  \emph{not} work  on a  graph paper,  and wandering
through it's unlikely  that you'll find what you're looking-for  --- but someone
must know the secret to navigating its passages. Perhaps someone in Anchor village?

\section{Port Lion}

The island of  Port Lion is home to  the village of Port Lion,  and is reachable
via a ship from the Treble docks.

\begin{figure*}[ht]
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}
      \draw (0,0) rectangle (10,10);
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{center}
  \addcontentsline{map}{map}{Map of Port Lion}
  \caption{Map of Port Lion}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{South Beaches}

One  the south  beaches  of  Port Lion  are  quite a  few  monsters  --- and  an
opportunity, on the docks,  to meet Fat Tony, who (as he  will tell you himself)
is the local expert on the geography of Port Lion.

Firend can be caught on the west end of the beach.

\subsection{Cliffs}

The village  of Port  Lion is  found atop some  high cliffs  that loom  over the
south beaches. There are a couple of paths up to the cliff-tops.

Fat  Tony will  tell  you about  a  legend  about one  area  of the  cliff-tops.
Perhaps it might be significant?

\subsection{Port Lion Village}

The village  of Port Lion is  a bustling community  that so far has  escaped the
notice of the monsters --- but for how long?

The villagers are fairly gossipy. Perhaps  if you solve the latest town mystery,
they can give you more information?

One villager's home has a Grizzard Depot inside, and he will cheerfully offer to
teach any Grizzard its last move. Since that is always its most powerful healing
move, that can be quite helpful.

\subsection{Lion Woods}

The Lion  Woods on  the north of  Port Lion  are a small  forest with  many evil
monsters prowling through it.

Corlyn can be found in the woods, if you search long enough.

\subsection{North Beaches}

Despite the plague of  monsters, some Port Lion residents still  try to fish off
the north  beaches. I wonder  what things other  than fish (and  monsters) might
turn up?

\section{Labyrinth}

Ancient legends tell of a mysterious labyrinth in WRITEME

\section{Dragons' Lairs}

The   lairs  of   the  three   dragons  are   accessible  only   through
the Labyrinth. Each  dragon's lair has a Grizzard Depot  and an arena in
which you can fight the dragon.

These lairs  are actually located  high above  the cliffs of  Port Lion.
You might notice  that the Port Lion  music can be heard  when you're in
these  lairs,   rather  than  the   underworld  music  that   you  might
have expected.

\chapter{Moves}\label{ch:Moves}

There are  64 Moves which can  be used by Grizzards  and monsters alike.

\section{Run Away}

You can run away from a fight, as long as the opposing monster is not a
Boss monster.

Running away does not heal your  Grizzard, but it does remove any Status
Effects that they may have received  (eg. Attack Down) during the fight.
It \emph{does},  however, allow the  monsters to fully  heal themselves,
and even  gather their forces ---  if you had  killed one of a  group of
monsters, a new one of the same kind will come to take its place.

\section{Grizzards' Moves}\label{sec:GrizzardMoves}

Each Grizzard is capable of learning  up to eight moves. There are three
ways to learn a move:

\begin{itemize}
\item Your Grizzard will know certain Moves when you first catch them.
\item When  a monster  uses a  Move against you  (or on  themself), your
  Grizzard can observe them and learn the Move from the monster.
\item Sometimes,  when gaining experience  by defeating a  monster, your
  Grizzard  will  spontaneously  discover  how  to  perform  a  Move  on
  their  own.  This occurs  less  frequently  than  learning a  Move  by
  observation, but it can happen.
\end{itemize}

The following shows all of the Moves that each Grizzard can learn.
See the  moves dictionary  starting on  page~\pageref{sec:MovesTable} to
see what the effects of each move can be.

\section{Monsters' Moves}\label{sec:MonsterMoves}

Monsters each  know only four Moves.  They will use attack  moves first,
and resort to healing Moves (if they know any) only when injured.

Boss monsters know the same Moves as their lesser, non-boss variety, but
of course they have higher stats.

The following table shows all of the Moves that each monster can use.

Boss monsters have the same moves as the common monsters of the same
type.

Note that a Wicked Slime is twice  as likely to pick Splish Splash as it
occupies two of its move slots.

\section{Moves' Effects}\label{sec:MovesTable}

Each  Move can  cause  damage,  or healing,  and  can  also impart  some
temporary  Status   Effects.  This  table  enumerates   every  Move  and
their effects.

The actual  amount of damage or  healing will vary somewhat;  the values
shown are the base amounts. Healing moves will always heal at least 1 HP.

\subsection{Defensive Moves}

These Moves are used by a creature on themself.
