\chapter{Grizzards}

There  are 30  different  Grizzards  that you  can  catch  and train  in
the  game.  Each   Grizzard  has  its  own  statistics   and  can  learn
different Moves. 

\begin{grizzardpage}{Dirtex}{01}{10}{1}{1}{Lander}

  Dirtex  is one  of the  Starter  Grizzards that  you can  choose at  the
  beginning of the game. A green anole-like Grizzard, it is native to dry,
  desert regions. Dirtex's Moves tend to be more aggressive than the other
  two Starters.

\end{grizzardpage}

\begin{grizzardpage}{Aquax}{02}{10}{1}{1}{Sailor}

  Aquax  is one  of  the Starter  Grizzards  that you  can  choose at  the
  beginning of the game. A brown  alligator-like Grizzard, it is native to
  swamps.  Of the  three Starters,  Aquax  is the  most balanced  Grizzard
  between attacking and defending Moves.

\end{grizzardpage}

\begin{grizzardpage}{Airex}{03}{10}{1}{1}{Flyer}

  Airex  is one  of the  Starter Grizazrds  that you  can choose  at the
  beginning of  the game. A  teal gecko-like  Grizzard, it lives  in the
  treetops. Airex's  Moves are more  focused on buffing,  debuffing, and
  healing Moves than the other two Starters.
  
\end{grizzardpage}

\begin{grizzardpage}{Flamex}{04}{20}{6}{4}{Burner}

  Flamex can be found in the Fire Bog.

  Flamex is a red salamander-like Grizzard
  
\end{grizzardpage}

\begin{grizzardpage}{Petty}{05}{30}{1}{1}{Tyrant}

  Petty is found near  the foot of the cliffs on the  south side of Port
  Lion, to the west of the paths that lead up the cliffs.

  While  Petty  is  a  surprisingly  weak Grizzard  at  first,  it  does
  metamorphose into  one of the stronger  Grizzards — Tyrant —  and from
  there,  eventually  can become  the  very  strongest Grizzard  of  all
  — Megax. Training Petty is a  difficult exercise, but it pays off well
  in the end.

  Petty is a brown, fat-tailed Grizzard.

\end{grizzardpage}

\begin{grizzardpage}{Wetnas}{06}{15}{6}{4}{}

  Wetnas is found on the narrow  road leading from Treble Village to the
  south, just north of the Lost  Mine's entrance. For most players, this
  will   be  the   first  Grizzard   that  you'll   catch,  after   your
  Starter Grizzard.

  While Wetnas's stats are an improvement  over the Starters, and it has
  better Moves, there  are advantages to returning to  Treble Village to
  switch back  to your Starter  Grizzard —  in particular, they  tend to
  metamorphose  into better  Grizzards than  Wetnas if  you continue  to
  train them.

  Wetnas is a turquoise chameleon-like Grizzard.
  
\end{grizzardpage}

\begin{grizzardpage}{Windoo}{07}{20}{6}{4}{}

  Windoo can be found in the center of the Spiral Wood.

  Windoo is a teal running Grizzard.

\end{grizzardpage}

\begin{grizzardpage}{Firend}{08}{30}66{Dufont}

  Firend is a seafoam green horned Grizzard.

\end{grizzardpage}

\begin{grizzardpage}{Lander}{09}{30}88{Zendex}

  Lander is a dark green anole-like Grizzard.

\end{grizzardpage}

\begin{grizzardpage}{Sailor}{10}{30}88{Oceax}

  Sailor is a gold alligator-like Grizzard.

\end{grizzardpage}

\begin{grizzardpage}{Flyer}{11}{30}88{Flitex}

  Flyer is a brown gecko-like Grizzard.

\end{grizzardpage}

\begin{grizzardpage}{Burner}{12}{30}{10}{8}{Flarex}

  Burner is a turquoise salamander-like Grizzard.

\end{grizzardpage}

\begin{grizzardpage}{Splodo}{13}{5}{75}{15}{}

  Splodo is a teal hump-backed Grizzard.

\end{grizzardpage}

\begin{grizzardpage}{Tyrant}{14}{60}{30}{40}{Megax}

  Tyrant is a dark yellow bipedal Grizzard.

\end{grizzardpage}

\begin{grizzardpage}{Dufont}{15}{30}{15}{15}{Wapow}

  Dufont is a blue salamander-like Grizzard.

\end{grizzardpage}

\begin{grizzardpage}{Theref}{16}{50}{45}{55}{}

  Theref is an indigo fat-tailed Grizzard.

\end{grizzardpage}

\begin{grizzardpage}{Cornet}{17}{30}{15}{15}{Uptrix}

  Cornet is  one of several  Grizzards found in  a cave north  of Anchor
  Village. You'll need a special key to unlock it.

  Cornet is a magenta horned Grizzard.

\end{grizzardpage}

\begin{grizzardpage}{Ambren}{18}{40}{20}{20}{Altrix}

  Ambren is  one of several  Grizzards found in  a cave north  of Anchor
  Village. You'll need a special key to unlock it.

  Ambren is an orange fat-tailed Grizzard.

\end{grizzardpage}

\begin{grizzardpage}{Noctis}{19}{40}{20}{20}{Ectrix}

  Noctis is  one of several  Grizzards found in  a cave north  of Anchor
  Village. You'll need a special key to unlock it.

  Noctis is a cyan horned Grizzard.

\end{grizzardpage}

\begin{grizzardpage}{Corlyn}{20}{40}{20}{20}{Ortrix}

  Corlyn can  be found hidden in  the eastern limits of  the Lion Woods.
  You may have to search for a while to reveal it.

  Corlyn is a green

\chapter{Monsters}\label{ch:Monsters}

The world of Syrex has been  invaded by hordes of monsters. Each monster
has its own Moves and statistics.

The statistics  for a monster  are raised when  you play in  Expert mode
(with the  Left Difficulty Switch  in the  ``A'' position), or  when you
encounter the  monster in New Game  Plus mode. In the  tables below, the
Enhanced value is  used in \emph{either} Expert mode  \emph{or} New Game
Plus. The  Severe value  is used  when playing  New Game  Plus \emph{in}
Expert Mode.



In addition,  nearly all monsters can  grow to Boss forms.  (Some unique
monsters \emph{only} occur in Boss forms, however.) Boss forms also have
enhanced statistics.

\chapter{Places}\label{ch:Places}

The world of Syrex can be considered to have three main areas:

\begin{itemize}
\item the Mainland,
\item the island of Port Lion,
\item and the Underworld.
\end{itemize}

Each area has its own distinct musical theme.

You  might also  notice that  when you're  above-ground, the  map screen
shows a  lighter colored ground  (compared to  the walls), but  when you
travel underground, the walls are lighter than the ground.

\section{The Mainland}

This is where you begin the game, and takes up the eastern side of the map.

\end{figure*}

Treble village has been destroyed almost completely by monsters, but a few brave
souls have hunkered  down. From the Grizzard  Depot in the east to  the docks in
the west, there isn't a single house left standing.

You'll   begin  the   game   in  the   ruins  of   Treble   village  with   your
Starting Grizzard.  You can only get  the two other Starter  Grizzards (the ones
you did not choose at first) by winning the game and beginning a New Game Plus.

    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{center}
  \addcontentsline{map}{map}{Map of the Fire Bog}
  \caption{Map of the Fire Bog}
\end{figure*}

The dangerous Fire Bog is full of monsters. Watch your step, or Flame Doggos and
Rodents of Unusual Size may attack you.

Near  the west  side of  the Fire  Bog,  a Boss  Rodent of  Unusual Size  blocks
a  particularly winding  path. In  the east,  one of  the survivors  from Treble
Village has an artifact that you'll need to open the tunnels under Mount Peshon,
and you can also catch Flamex.

The road running along the north side of Mount Peshon reaches from the Lost Mine
in the west to the Spiral Woods in  the east. Near the Spiral Woods, a crossroad
joins up to the Fire Bog and the entrance to the Mount Peshon tunnels.

A lonely radio repair shop can be found near the Lost Mine entrance.

\end{figure*}

Mount Peshon  divides the mainland into  a northern and southern  side. The only
way through are a series of tunnels beneath the mountain.

When the  game begins, the  tunnels cannot be  opened because the  two artifacts
used to open them, which were in Treble village, are missing.

If  you do  manage to  get into  the  tunnels, your  passage may  be blocked  by
emergency barricades  that are  put up whenever  a Grue is  heard in  the caves.
Nobody knows quite what a Grue looks  like, because they usually eat anyone that
comes across them, and they live in the dark places beneath Syrex.

It's  also been  known that  there are  side  caves off  the main  one in  which
a terrible Cyclops is raising a herd of venomous sheep.

The Spiral Woods are full of  Crazy Foxes, Vorpal Bunnies, and Will-O-Wisps, but
somewhere in the center of the forest is a Grizzard Depot.

One of  the survivors of Treble  Village can be  found in the Woods,  holding an
important artifact.

A Grizzard Trainer in Anchor village will  tell you that she's lost a pendant in
the Spiral Woods. If you find an  area with relatively few monsters, it might be
wise to search for that pendant --- there's sure to be a great reward.

Windoo can be found in the Spiral Woods.

\subsection{Southern Fields}

  \caption{Map of the Southern Field and Anchor Village}
\end{figure*}

The Southern Fields are beset with monsters, too, now, but they haven't yet come
up into Anchor Village.

The  only  way  in  or  out  of   the  Southern  Fields  is  through  the  Mount
Peshon tunnel, but there is a hidden cave into Mount Peshon as well. If you find
the key to revealing the cave's entrance, you'll also discover a hidden Grizzard
Depot nearby.

\subsection{Anchor Village}

Still mostly  unharmed by the  monsters, Anchor  Village is built  around Anchor
Rock, a large red monolith from the ancient past.

Villagers here can be very helpful,  manufacturing potions, using their radio to
call ships  to the Treble  village docks, or even  giving you access  to trained
Grizzards that they no longer need: Cornet, Ambren, and Noctis.

\section{Lost Mine}

Delving deep into the underworld, the Lost Mine is a maze in which it is far too
easy to lose yourself. Even going back the  way in which you came might take you
someplace different, if you're not careful.

Somewhere in the mine can be found Splodo, near an abandoned Grizzard Depot.

Mapping  the Lost  Mine does  \emph{not} work  on a  graph paper,  and wandering
through it's unlikely  that you'll find what you're looking-for  --- but someone
must know the secret to navigating its passages. Perhaps someone in Anchor village?

\section{Port Lion}

The island of  Port Lion is home to  the village of Port Lion,  and is reachable
via a ship from the Treble docks.

\begin{figure*}[ht]

  \addcontentsline{map}{map}{Map of Port Lion}
  \caption{Map of Port Lion}
\end{figure*}

\subsection{South Beaches}

One  the south  beaches  of  Port Lion  are  quite a  few  monsters  --- and  an
opportunity, on the docks,  to meet Fat Tony, who (as he  will tell you himself)
is the local expert on the geography of Port Lion.

Firend can be caught on the west end of the beach.

\subsection{Cliffs}

The village  of Port  Lion is  found atop some  high cliffs  that loom  over the
south beaches. There are a couple of paths up to the cliff-tops.

Fat  Tony will  tell  you about  a  legend  about one  area  of the  cliff-tops.
Perhaps it might be significant?

\subsection{Port Lion Village}

The village  of Port Lion is  a bustling community  that so far has  escaped the
notice of the monsters --- but for how long?

The villagers are fairly gossipy. Perhaps  if you solve the latest town mystery,
they can give you more information?

One villager's home has a Grizzard Depot inside, and he will cheerfully offer to
teach any Grizzard its last move. Since that is always its most powerful healing
move, that can be quite helpful.

\subsection{Lion Woods}

The Lion  Woods on  the north of  Port Lion  are a small  forest with  many evil
monsters prowling through it.

Corlyn can be found in the woods, if you search long enough.

\subsection{North Beaches}

Despite the plague of  monsters, some Port Lion residents still  try to fish off
the north  beaches. I wonder  what things other  than fish (and  monsters) might
turn up?

\section{Dragons' Lairs}

The   lairs  of   the  three   dragons  are   accessible  only   through
the Labyrinth. Each  dragon's lair has a Grizzard Depot  and an arena in
which you can fight the dragon.

These lairs  are actually located  high above  the cliffs of  Port Lion.
You might notice  that the Port Lion  music can be heard  when you're in
these  lairs,   rather  than  the   underworld  music  that   you  might
have expected.

\chapter{Moves}\label{ch:Moves}

There are 64 Moves which can be used by Grizzards and monsters alike.

\section{Run Away}

You can run away from a fight, as long as the opposing monster is not a
Boss monster.

Running away does not heal your  Grizzard, but it does remove any Status
Effects that they may have received  (eg. Attack Down) during the fight.
It \emph{does},  however, allow the  monsters to fully  heal themselves,
and even  gather their forces ---  if you had  killed one of a  group of
monsters, a new one of the same kind will come to take its place.

\section{Grizzards' Moves}\label{sec:GrizzardMoves}

Each Grizzard is capable of learning  up to eight moves. There are three
ways to learn a move:

\begin{itemize}
\item Your Grizzard will know certain Moves when you first catch them.
\item When  a monster  uses a  Move against you  (or on  themself), your
  Grizzard can observe them and learn the Move from the monster.
\item Sometimes,  when gaining experience  by defeating a  monster, your
  Grizzard  will  spontaneously  discover  how  to  perform  a  Move  on
  their  own.  This occurs  less  frequently  than  learning a  Move  by
  observation, but it can happen.
\end{itemize}

The following shows all of the Moves that each Grizzard can learn.
See the  moves dictionary  starting on  page~\pageref{sec:MovesTable} to
see what the effects of each move can be.

\section{Monsters' Moves}\label{sec:MonsterMoves}

Monsters each  know only four Moves.  They will use attack  moves first,
and resort to healing Moves (if they know any) only when injured.

Boss monsters know the same Moves as their lesser, non-boss variety, but
of course they have higher stats.

The following table shows all of the Moves that each monster can use.

Boss monsters have the same moves as the common monsters of the same
type.

Some monsters know less than four distinct moves. For examples, a Wicked
Slime is twice as likely to pick Splish Splash as it occupies two of its
move slots.

\section{Moves' Effects}\label{sec:MovesTable}

Each  Move can  cause  damage,  or healing,  and  can  also impart  some
temporary  Status   Effects.  This  table  enumerates   every  Move  and
their effects.

The actual  amount of damage or  healing will vary somewhat;  the values
shown are the base amounts. Healing moves will always heal at least 1 HP.

\subsection{Effectiveness}

Moves have a base effectiveness, shown in the following tables. However,
their base  effectiveness is modified by  a random factor. This  is like
``rolling  for  damage''   in  a  tabletop  RPG.  The   exact  range  of
effectiveness  of  any  Move  can  be determined  based  upon  its  base
effectiveness with the following table:

\begin{tabular}{l c}
  Base Effectiveness & Random Modifier \\
  1 - 3 & $\pm 1$ \\
  4 - 7 & $\pm 3$ \\
  8 - 15 & $\pm 7$ \\
  16 - 31 & $\pm 15$ \\
  32 - 63 & $\pm 31$ \\
  64 + & $\pm 63$ \\
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Defensive Moves}

These Moves are used by a creature on themself.

\begin{tabular}{l c l}
  Move & Healing & Status Effects \\
  Common Cure & 10 & \\
  Fire Start & & Attack Up \\
  First Aid & 2 & \\
  Great Cure & 25 & \\
  Heal Wound & 50 & \\
  Life Return & 99 & \\
  Raise Hope & & Defend Up \\
  Run Away & & (run away) \\
  Simple Cure & 5 & \\
  Sure Splash & & Attack Up \\
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Attack Moves}

These Moves are used against an enemy creature.

\begin{tabular}{l c l}

\chapter{Cheats \& Easter Eggs}

\textit{Grizzards} contains several cheat codes and Easter eggs that you
can exploit.

\section{Dedication Screen}

While the Attract (title) sequence is  playing, wait for the screen with
the copyright notice. Press Down on  the joystick during the few seconds
that this screen is visible to reach a Dedication screen. In addition to
the game's Dedication, the AtariVox will mention a few specific credits,
and the date of the build of the game will be displayed as well.

\section{New Game Instant Plus}

If you want  to reach the New  Game Plus mode without having  to win the
game first (note:  this is basically the same as  playing in Expert mode
by setting the  Left Difficulty Switch to ``A''), you  can register your
name  as  \texttt{KINGME}  when  you  begin  a  game.  You'll  hear  the
``Victory'' jingle,  and then be  prompted again for  your \emph{actual}
name to appear on the file.

Note that  you will  get all three  Starters, so which  one you  pick is
basically  ignored. Visit  the Depot  to choose  which one  you want  to
accompany you; by default, it will always be Airex.

\section{Secret Room}

There is a secret  room to be found … it serves no  purpose in the game,
but exists only to amuse you. To find it …

\section{Instant Megax}

To get a ``free'' Megax (this is  just plain cheating), go to the Select
Slot screen and  select your game in progress. Then,  while that slot is
visible, press the  joystick in this pattern: Up, Up,  Down, Down, Left,
Right,  Left, Right.  You'll hear  the ``Combat  Victory'' jingle  play.
Press the  Fire button to start  playing, and you'll find  that you have
a Megax now. However, to show that  you have cheated, your score will be
permanently ``tainted''  with a leading  ``F'' on  it. You will  also be
ineligible for a High Score.

The only way  to get rid of the  ``F'' (but, keep your Megax)  is to win
the game and continue in New Game Plus mode with a fresh (zero) score.

\section{Clear High Scores}

The official AtariAge cartridge version (only) has a High Score display.
However, you  can destroy  the evidence  of your high  score. To  do so,
\emph{with the  Power Off}, hold  down both  Select and Reset  while you
turn on the Power switch. The High Score data will be silently destroyed
and the next player to win will become the High Score holder.

Note  that the  High  Score display  is part  of  the Attract  sequence.
It  occurs after  the ``story''  screen  in which  the Grizzard  attacks
various monsters, but it \emph{does not} occur if there is no High Score
saved to the cartridge.
